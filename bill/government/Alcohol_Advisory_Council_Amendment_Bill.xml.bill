          <text>This Bill amends the Alcohol Advisory Council Act 1976 (the <def-term id="DLM1149702">Act</def-term>) to update and simplify the current mechanisms for setting the Alcohol Advisory Council (<def-term id="DLM1149703">ALAC</def-term>) levy. ALAC is funded by a levy on all alcoholic beverages manufactured in or imported into New Zealand.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In 2004, the Ministry of Health reviewed the current levy-setting mechanisms. The review found that the way that the levy is calculated and apportioned is outdated and overly complex. Furthermore, there is no process for Cabinet involvement in setting the levy.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This Bill proposes to calculate the ALAC levy for each product according to a system using alcohol classification bands. This is similar to the approach used by the New Zealand Customs Service to collect alcohol excise and excise-equivalent duty. Under this system, a dollar amount per litre would be set for each alcoholic beverage according to its alcohol content or deemed alcohol content. This means that alcoholic beverages with a higher volume of alcohol will contribute a higher proportion to the levy. The Bill will provide for the Governor-General to make regulations that fix the rate of levy payable.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The proposed regime is up to date and simple to calculate. It is also future-proofed against the emergence of new types of beverages that would not easily fit into any liquor class (ie, beer, wine, fortified wine, or spirits) in the current system.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The Ministry of Health (the <emphasis style="bold">Ministry</emphasis>) has reviewed the levy-setting mechanisms for the Alcohol Advisory Council (<def-term id="DLM1149706">ALAC</def-term>) levy as set out in sections 2 and 25 to 27 of the Alcohol Advisory Council Act 1976 (the <def-term id="DLM1149707">Act</def-term>). The Alcohol Advisory Council Amendment Bill proposes to amend the Act by replacing the current levy-setting system with the New Zealand Customs Service’s (<def-term id="DLM1149708">Customs</def-term>) excise alcohol classification bands and retain the collection of a separate levy for ALAC. This option addresses the problems with the current levy-setting mechanisms by introducing an updated and simple classification system that reflects the current alcohol market and future-proofs the levy against new types of alcoholic products.</text>

        <para>
          <text>ALAC was established under the Act to promote responsible drinking and strategies that will minimise alcohol misuse. ALAC is funded by a levy on alcohol produced and imported for sale in New Zealand. According to the Act, the Minister fixes the proportion of the aggregate levy to be borne by 4 classes of liquor, namely: beer, wine, fortified wines, and spirits. The levy is calculated in the same ratio as the volume of each class of liquor imported into or manufactured in New Zealand during the preceding year. Payments from producers and importers are made monthly to Customs which forwards the levy, minus the costs of collection, to ALAC. The total levy amount for ALAC during the 2005/2006 financial year was $12.996 million.</text>

        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Bring ALAC levy under excise and excise-equivalent duty</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Option 1 proposes to raise ALAC's  revenue through an earmarked one-off percentage increase in excise and excise-equivalent duty and an annually adjusted percentage increase thereafter. The annual inflation increase on excise would maintain the real value of excise and then a percentage for the ALAC proportion, which changes annually depending on ALAC's  funding requirement, would be added. Bringing the ALAC levy within excise duty would end the need for a separate levy collection as Customs would collect the ALAC proportion along with excise collection. This is likely to have little impact on industry as excise and the ALAC levy will be simultaneously collected on 1 July, as of 2007.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Option 1, as in the preferred option below, would provide ALAC with no greater security of revenue. This is because ALAC's  revenue would still vary according to how much excise was collected, which is dependent on volumes of alcohol manufactured in and imported into New Zealand during the financial year. The Ministry would continue to determine the aggregate levy for the year. Including the ALAC proportion within excise but separating it from annual inflation indexation would involve costly system changes for Customs. The collection of ALAC's  funding would only be simplified if the ALAC proportion were completely included within excise and this would also offer industry additional, minor, compliance-cost reductions.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Funding through Vote: Health</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Option 2 proposes to replace the ALAC levy with funding through Vote: Health. The Ministry would review ALAC's  budget and would assume responsibility for funding arrangements. There would be a one-off increase to Vote: Health but any further increases in ALAC's  funding would be absorbed within Vote: Health. Option 2 may be less time-consuming as the ALAC levy currently requires input into parliamentary questions and receives requests under the Official Information Act 1982. Option 2 would provide ALAC with greater security of funding as revenue would no longer be dependent upon the varying volume of alcohol manufactured in and imported into New Zealand during the financial year. There would be no levy collected by Customs. Industry would cease to have any direct involvement with the funding of ALAC and it would remove the apparent link to ALAC's  funding by the alcohol industry, meaning a significantly reduced cost to industry.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Preferred option</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <explnote.subhead1>Excise alcohol classification bands</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option proposes to replace the current classes of liquor with a system based on the alcohol classification bands used by Customs to collect alcohol excise and excise-equivalent duty. This would remove the categories of alcohol that currently exist, namely beer, wine, fortified wine, and spirits. Alcoholic beverages would be defined instead by alcohol content and the levy would be calculated for each product according to which alcohol classification band it falls into. ALAC would continue to receive the levy in the same way as it does under the current system and Customs would continue to collect the ALAC levy. The preferred option would not require any administrative changes or additional costs for Customs.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The alcohol industry will be familiar with these bands as they are based on the existing excise regime. The preferred option (as well as option 1) would entail small financial adjustments for alcohol manufacturers and importers, provided that stakeholders receive sufficient advance notice of excise adjustments, including the ALAC proportion. Under this regime, lower-strength beers would incur a lower levy than under the status quo and higher-strength beers would be levied at a slightly higher rate. There would be a small change to the wine industry. This option would favour lower strength fortified wines with less than the equivalent of 18% alcohol. The most noticeable change would be to the spirits industry. There would be a significant change for lower strength spirits, which would be levied according to their actual alcohol content.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option (as well as option 1) would include an amendment to provide for the Governor-General, by Order in Council, to make regulations to fix the rate of levy payable. This could prove to be more time consuming for the Ministry as it will be required to undertake consultation to comply with the Cabinet Office processes.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>On balance, the Ministry considers that the preferred option uses an up-to-date classification system that reflects the current alcohol market and future-proofs the levy against new types of alcoholic products. Using a system based on alcohol content would simplify the way the levy is calculated with little cost to Customs during the implementation of this option. Furthermore, this option maintains the direct contribution by alcohol importers and manufacturers to the work of ALAC in the reduction of alcohol-related harm.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Implementation and review</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>All options proposed for amending the existing levy-setting provisions require amendments to the Act, in particular section 2, sections 25 to 34, and section 39. Option 1 would also require amendments to the Customs and Excise Act 1996 to allow for an initial increase in, and subsequent annual adjustments to, the excise duty. In the case of replacing the ALAC levy with funding from Vote: Health, section 20(2)(a) and section 1A of the Act, which provide that one of the purposes of the Act, is to make provision for the funding of ALAC’s activities by means of a levy on liquor imported into, or manufactured in, New Zealand, would also need to be amended.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Customs would continue to enforce the collection of ALAC's  funding under the preferred option. The Ministry is responsible for ensuring that stakeholders receive sufficient advance notice of the ALAC levy each year, which will facilitate industry compliance with the levy. It is envisaged that ALAC would provide an evaluation of the revised levy-setting procedure in its annual report to the Ministry.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Alcohol Advisory Council Amendment Bill has been approved for the 2007 Legislative Programme with a category 4 priority. The intention is for the revised levy-setting procedures to be implemented for the 2008/2009 levy.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Consultation</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>In November 2006, the Ministry conducted a targeted consultation with ALAC and external stakeholders on the options to replace the current system with excise alcohol classification bands and to bring the ALAC levy within excise. Stakeholders included the Distilled Spirits Association, New Zealand Winegrowers, the Beer, Wine and Spirits Council, DB Breweries, and Lion Nathan.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Distilled Spirits Association supported the preferred option but considered that the levy should be based purely on alcohol content and not the mixture of deemed values and exact percentages used by Customs. Customs noted that it is not feasible to verify the alcoholic content of all alcoholic products. New Zealand Winegrowers considered that ALAC's  funding should be drawn from the amount of excise already collected. The former Beer, Wine and Spirits Council considered that either using alcohol classification bands or bringing the ALAC levy within excise were acceptable provided that beer and wine were not disadvantaged compared to spirits. Lion Nathan supported adjusting the annual excise duty rather than funding ALAC through a separate levy.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Treasury, the Ministry of Economic Development, and all government agencies that comprise the Inter-Agency Committee on Drugs were invited to consult on the 3 options for adjusting the existing levy-setting provisions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade was also consulted on possible implications for any obligations that New Zealand may have under international treaties relating to levy setting mechanisms.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>ALAC considered its independence would be best maintained through a separate levy rather than an adjustment to excise. Treasury considered that the preferred option offers greater transparency because the portion of revenue allocated for ALAC would not be hidden within the excise duty. The Ministry of Social Development supported the move to a levy system based on alcohol bands as proposed under the preferred option and option 1. Customs considered that the collection of ALAC's  funding would be simplified and stakeholders would achieve compliance-cost savings from bringing the ALAC levy within excise, but only if the ALAC proportion is included in the annual indexation of excise. Following this, the Ministry of Economic Development supported the move to a levy system based on alcohol classification bands and considered that bringing the ALAC levy within excise offers an efficient method to collect the ALAC levy. Youth Development was the only government agency to support replacing the ALAC levy with funding from Vote: Health.</text>
