        <para>
          <text>This Bill amends the Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994 by inserting a <emphasis style="italic">new Part 5A</emphasis>. The Bill implements many of New Zealand’s obligations under Annex VI to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty on Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies (the <def-term id="DLM2051602">Liability Annex</def-term>). The Liability Annex deals with liability for environmental emergencies occurring in Antarctica. It was adopted in 2005 by the 28th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting but has not yet entered into force.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill requires operators (those organising or conducting Antarctic activities) to take prompt, effective response action when environmental emergencies arise from their activities. New Zealand operators must notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade if they cause or discover an environmental emergency. If an operator fails to take prompt, effective response action, a Party to the Liability Annex (an <def-term id="DLM2051603">Annex Party</def-term>) may do so, and the defaulting operator must reimburse the Annex Party’s costs. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Where no Annex Party takes response action to an environmental emergency caused by a New Zealand operator, the High Court may order the operator to pay an amount representing the costs that would have been incurred had prompt and effective response action been taken. This amount will be paid into an Environmental Protection Fund administered by the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill also sets out the situations in which an operator is exempt from liability, and imposes a financial limit on liability (expressed in International Monetary Fund special drawing rights, equivalent to a minimum of US$1.5 million for environmental emergencies involving a ship, and US$4.5 million for other environmental emergencies). Liability is strict, and attaches to both State and non-State operators. The Bill removes the requirement for the Attorney-General to consent to civil proceedings against operators, since the Bill aims to facilitate such actions and requiring the Attorney-General's approval could be seen as a barrier. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Liability Annex does not define “State operator”. Instead, each Annex Party must decide which of its operators are State operators. New Zealand will accept another Annex Party's decision, because State operators are not exempt from liability. Each Annex Party will be responsible for the actions of its State operators under international law. For this reason, the Bill does not cover the State operators of other Annex Parties, which will instead be covered by the relevant Annex Party's domestic legislation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Liability Annex will enter into force once it has been approved by all 28 Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, including New Zealand. Enactment of this Bill will enable New Zealand to approve the Liability Annex. The Bill will be brought into force by Order in Council once the Liability Annex itself enters into force.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Annex VI to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty on Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies (the <def-term id="DLM2051607">Liability Annex</def-term>) was adopted by the 28th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (<emphasis style="bold">ATCM</emphasis>) in June 2005.  New Zealand and other Antarctic Treaty countries are now seeking to approve the Liability Annex so that it can enter into force.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Liability Annex establishes a regime of liability for damage to the Antarctic environment arising from activities conducted there by Parties to the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection.  Operators (those organising Antarctic activities) must take preventative measures to reduce the likelihood of accidents harming the Antarctic environment; establish contingency plans to deal with harmful incidents; and take prompt, effective response action when environmental emergencies arise from their activities.  If an operator fails to take prompt and effective response action to protect the environment, others may endeavour to do so, and the defaulting operator must reimburse their costs.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Liability Annex also establishes legal mechanisms for the recovery of these costs; sets out certain exemptions from liability; requires Antarctic operators to have insurance; and imposes a financial limit on liability (expressed in International Monetary Fund special drawing rights, equivalent to a minimum of US$1.5 million for environmental emergencies involving a ship, and US$4.5 million for other environmental emergencies). Liability is strict (it does not require proof that the environmental emergency arose from an operator’s fault or negligence) and applies to both government and private operators. Legislation will be needed to implement most aspects of the Liability Annex.</text>

          <text>The Antarctic Treaty entered into force for New Zealand on 23 June 1961. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the <def-term id="DLM2051608">Environmental Protocol</def-term>) entered into force for New Zealand on 14 January 1998. The Liability Annex was adopted by the ATCM held in Stockholm in June 2005. </text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Background</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The adoption of the Liability Annex fulfils a longstanding obligation on Antarctic Treaty countries, including New Zealand, to conclude an annex to the Environmental Protocol setting out legal liability for damage to the Antarctic environment. This obligation is contained in article 16 of the Environmental Protocol. The Liability Annex is an important element of the Antarctic environmental protection regime.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The Liability Annex will enter into force once it has been approved by all Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, including New Zealand (Environmental Protocol, article 9(2) and Antarctic Treaty, article IX). New Zealand plays an active role in the Antarctic Treaty System and strongly supports its objectives.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Approving the Liability Annex is an opportunity to highlight and promote, both domestically and internationally, New Zealand’s support for a strong environmental protection regime for Antarctica. In addition, because of the leading role New Zealand played in chairing the negotiations, New Zealand will be expected to be one of the first countries to formally approve the Liability Annex. To date, only Sweden, Peru, Poland, and Spain have approved the Liability Annex. Twenty of the remaining 24 Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have indicated that they have started their internal review processes for approving the Liability Annex. As well as New Zealand, these countries include Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.</text>

          <text>It is proposed that New Zealand adopt the legislation necessary to approve the Liability Annex, but not bring this legislation into force until the Liability Annex itself enters into force following its approval by all the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties. This process is expected to take several years.</text>

Parties can choose to resolve disputes relating to an annex using either or both of the International Court of Justice and the Arbitral Tribunal (details of which are contained in the Schedule to the Environmental Protocol). By default, Parties are deemed to have accepted the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal (Environmental Protocol, article 19(3)). If parties to a dispute have not accepted the same means, or have both accepted both means, then the dispute shall be submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal, unless the parties agree otherwise (Environmental Protocol, article 19(5) and (6)).</text>

          <text>This legislation will take the form of an amendment to the existing Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act 1994 (the <emphasis style="bold">1994 Act</emphasis>). The amending Bill is expected to contain approximately 5 clauses of medium complexity.

        <explnote.subhead1>Implementation using administrative procedures</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Some Liability Annex obligations will not require legislative amendments, as they can instead be implemented through existing administrative procedures. These obligations will be attached as conditions (<def-term id="DLM2051609">Ministerial directions</def-term>) to environmental impact assessments conducted under the 1994 Act. Section 10(1)(b) of the 1994 Act provides that the Minister may <quote.in quote="1">direct any person carrying out ... any activity</quote.in> in Antarctica to <quote.in quote="1">abide by such conditions as the Minister considers appropriate in order to avoid or minimise the effects of the activity on the Antarctic environment</quote.in>. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The obligations proposed to be implemented as conditions in this way are operators’ obligations to take preventative measures and establish contingency plans (Liability Annex, articles 3 and 4) and to carry insurance or a financial guarantee to cover their liability (Liability Annex, article 11). This is an appropriate mechanism for implementing these obligations, since reducing the risk of environmental emergencies occurring in Antarctica is one of the Liability Annex’s primary aims. The New Zealand procedures for non-governmental visitors to Antarctica (available on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Internet site) will be updated to ensure non-State operators are aware of the requirement to provide this information along with their environmental impact assessment.</text>

          <text>Approving the Liability Annex, and therefore ultimately allowing it to enter into force, will have long-term benefits for the Antarctic environment. In particular, requiring operators to take preventative measures and establish contingency plans will reduce the likelihood of accidents harming the Antarctic environment. Imposing legal liability to clean up or pay the costs of response action where damage does occur will act as an incentive for operators to minimise damage to the environment.</text>

                <text>maintained adequate insurance or other financial security, such as a bank guarantee, to cover liability for response action taken by a party to the Environmental Protocol where the operator fails to take prompt and effective response action. Such insurance must cover liability up to the financial limits of liability set out in article 9(1) and (2) of the Liability Annex (expressed in International Monetary Fund special drawing rights, equivalent to a minimum of US$1.5 million for environmental emergencies involving a ship, and US$4.5 million for other environmental emergencies). These limits were judged to reflect an appropriate balance between the need to set limits sufficiently high to offer a deterrent, and the need to keep financial risks within reasonable limits.</text>

        <para>
          <text>State (government) operators must also meet the same requirements as private operators, outlined above. However the Liability Annex allows parties to elect to self-insure rather than carry insurance for State operators. Since Antarctica New Zealand’s activities are primarily land-based, the maximum level of exposure for which it may be liable in respect of any one incident is 3 million SDRs (currently equivalent to approximately US $4.5 million). Antarctica New Zealand currently carries public liability insurance sufficient to cover this exposure. As a result, there is no need to take up the self-insurance option in respect of Antarctica New Zealand.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The New Zealand Defence Force (<def-term id="DLM2051610">NZDF</def-term>) operates C-130 Hercules and P3K Orion aircraft in the Antarctic. Accordingly, its maximum level of exposure in respect of any one incident would also be US $4.5 million. In the case of an environmental emergency arising from a ship (should NZDF operate vessels in the Antarctic Treaty area in the future), the limit on liability is set at US $1.5 million for a ship of 2 000 gross tonnes, increasing by a sliding scale with each additional tonne. NZDF currently carries aviation and marine protection and indemnity insurance sufficient to cover this exposure. As a result, there is no need to take up the self-insurance option in respect of NZDF.</text>

        <para>
          <text>New Zealand government agencies such as the Ministry of Fisheries and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research also undertake scientific research voyages from time to time in the Antarctic Treaty area (south of 60°S). Such voyages will also be covered by the Liability Annex once it enters into force. As these voyages are ship-based, the relevant limit on liability for an environmental emergency arising from their activities would start at US $1.5 million for a ship of 2 000 gross tonnes, increasing by a sliding scale with each additional tonne. Such voyages have previously carried public liability insurance sufficient to cover this exposure, and would be required to do so following the Liability Annex’s entry into force. As a result, there is no need to take up the government self-insurance option provided in the Annex in respect of State operators conducting Antarctic research voyages.</text>

          <text>The Liability Annex creates liability for the costs of response action (such as containing an oil spill), but does not create liability for irreparable damage to the environment itself. This reflects adamant resistance from a number of countries during the negotiation of the Liability Annex. However, in a compromise, the ATCM decided when adopting the Liability Annex to defer the issue of irreparable damage to future negotiations.</text>

In addition, it is possible to withdraw from either treaty at any time by consent of all parties to the treaty (Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 54).</text>
