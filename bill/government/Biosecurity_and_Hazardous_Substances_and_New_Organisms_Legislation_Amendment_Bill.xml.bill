          <text>It is intended that this Bill be divided into the following 2 separate Bills at the committee of the whole House stage: a Biosecurity Amendment Bill and a Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Amendment Bill.</text>

        <explnote.crosshead>Purpose of Bill</explnote.crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The purpose of this Bill is to resolve an issue about the roles of two different Acts in managing risks to New Zealand from incidentally imported new organisms. These Acts are the Biosecurity Act 1993 (the <emphasis style="bold">Biosecurity Act</emphasis>) and the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 (the <emphasis style="bold">HSNO Act</emphasis>).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Should the Bill not proceed, the importation of goods into New Zealand will be impeded, causing economic loss to importers, lost opportunities for New Zealand overall, and potential issues of inconsistency with New Zealand’s World Trade Organisation obligations.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.crosshead>Legislation for managing risks associated with importing new organisms</explnote.crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>New organisms can arrive in New Zealand in two principal ways. Organisms can be deliberately imported, usually with the intention of putting them to some specific use. Alternatively, they may arrive incidentally in association with traded goods.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Biosecurity Act provides the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (<emphasis style="bold">MAF</emphasis>) with the statutory basis for its biosecurity role, including its long-established function of protecting New Zealand from incidentally imported harmful organisms. The Act requires that <quote.in quote="1">risk goods</quote.in> that may bring harmful organisms into New Zealand must comply with an <quote.in quote="1">import health standard</quote.in> issued by the Director-General of MAF before being cleared for entry.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The HSNO Act provides a legislative basis to regulate intentional introductions of new organisms. A person intending to import a new organism must apply to the Environmental Risk Management Authority (<emphasis style="bold">ERMA</emphasis>) for approval.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.crosshead>Problem arising from existing statutory scheme</explnote.crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>Risk goods can have many hundreds, or even thousands, of new organisms associated with them. Biosecurity Act processes by necessity aim to manage biosecurity risk to an acceptable level rather than eliminate it, and so it is inevitable that some new organisms will enter the country in association with imported goods. HSNO Act processes, on the other hand, are triggered by an applicant seeking approval to deliberately import or release a new organism.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The fact that most imported goods have the potential to bring new organisms into New Zealand with them results in a significant overlap between the provisions of the Biosecurity Act and the HSNO Act. The HSNO Act includes, in section 25, a general prohibition on the importation and release of any new organism except in accordance with an approval from ERMA. That provision is reinforced by section 28 of the Biosecurity Act, which specifically prohibits an inspector from giving biosecurity clearance for a new organism.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This overlap has caused some uncertainty in the past as to how each Act applies to the incidental importation of new organisms. The recent Court of Appeal decision, <emphasis style="italic">National Beekeepers’ Association of New Zealand v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry</emphasis> [2007] NZCA 556, has clarified the scope of the two Acts in its finding that all new organisms imported into New Zealand must have prior approval under the HSNO Act, regardless of whether they are imported intentionally or incidentally.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Court of Appeal decision creates an unworkable legal framework for the management of biosecurity risks at the border. This lack of workability stems from the fundamental difference between approving the importation of risk goods that may incidentally have new organisms on or in them, versus approving the intentional importation of a new organism. The risks posed by an organism being imported incidentally in association with a particular good are very different from the risks posed by that organism if it was to be intentionally imported in large quantities with the purpose of establishing it in the New Zealand environment.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>HSNO Act processes are not intended for managing the risk from organisms that are incidentally associated with imported goods. There are several different approval processes in the HSNO Act, but none is suited because—</text>

              <para>
                <text>HSNO Act processes are designed to consider all of the risks associated with intentionally importing and releasing a new organism, possibly in large quantities and at many locations, rather than the specific risks presented by an organism when it is imported incidentally in or on traded goods:</text>

                <text>the net benefit criteria for importing a new organism, which applies to most HSNO Act approval processes, would be difficult to satisfy for new organisms that have no obvious useful purpose.</text>

              <para>
                <text>to ensure that the Biosecurity Act import health standard process is not improperly used as a <quote.in quote="1">backdoor</quote.in> means for deliberately introducing new organisms, any new organism incidentally imported in association with goods cleared for entry under the Biosecurity Act will remain <quote.in quote="1">new</quote.in>. The definition of develop in the HSNO Act will be expanded to prohibit incidentally imported new organisms from being isolated and used without an approval from ERMA:</text>

              <para>
                <text>the expanded definition of develop creates a need for consequential amendment to the HSNO Act so that government biosecurity agencies can carry out necessary activities with new organisms during biosecurity responses.  Some actions taken by government agencies during responses, such as those in laboratories to identify and carry out research on organisms, will be exempted from the need for a HSNO Act approval. The exemption will be limited to activities falling within the new part of the definition of <quote.in quote="1">develop</quote.in>, and a HSNO Act approval will still be required for other developments and for the release or field testing of new organisms:</text>

              <para>
                <text>in light of the uncertainty generated by the Court of Appeal decision for existing Biosecurity Act import health standards, the Bill validates the lawfulness of existing import health standards, and past decisions made by MAF that might be affected by the Court of Appeal decision:</text>

                <text>the validations are extended specifically to include the <emphasis style="italic">Import Health Standard for the Importation into New Zealand of Specified Bee Products from Australia</emphasis> and the decisions based on it. This is because, although the Court of Appeal set aside that standard, the judgment did not confer any specific right on any person and the grounds of the challenge to that import health standard did not call into question the reasonableness of MAF's risk management decision.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The definition of new organism under the HSNO Act includes both non-genetically modified organisms and genetically modified organisms. The current arrangements for preventing the importation of unapproved genetically modified organisms are not changed by the Bill. The absolute prohibition on the import of genetically modified organisms that have not been approved by ERMA will be retained.</text>
