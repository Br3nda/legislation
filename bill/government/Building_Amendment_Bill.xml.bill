        <heading>Introduction</heading>
        <para>
          <text>The bill makes minor adjustments to the Building Act 2004 to improve its clarity, and to ensure that it is workable and achieves its intended purpose. The Building Act 2004 was introduced to strengthen the regulation of building in order to minimise the possibility of building failure, in response to the high incidence of major building faults from the mid-1990s to 2001. The bill would make adjustments to clarify parts of the Act relating to building consent exemptions and restricted building work. The amendments would adjust the dam safety and dam owners' accreditation regime, making the accreditation and audit fee system more flexible so that a product certification scheme could be established. The bill also requires project information memoranda to include a reminder about access provisions for disabled persons. The amendments we are recommending are of a technical nature. </text>

        <heading>Restricted building work exemptions</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We understand that regulations to be introduced under the Building Act 2004 may exempt buildings below a certain size or design threshold from the requirement that a licensed building practitioner oversee the work. While a licensed building practitioner might not be essential for building these structures, a building consent and building inspection should continue to be required. We emphasise the need to maintain the permit regime whereby local authorities can check plans and conduct inspections in the usual way. The 2004 Act was designed to improve building standards, including work done by unqualified and DIY builders, and this bill adds clarity.</text>

        <heading>National Party Minority View</heading>
        <para>
          <text>The National Party opposes the Building Amendment Bill 2007 because it fails to address the massive bureaucratic problems with the original Building Act and does nothing to improve home affordability or the increased rates costs to homeowners.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In our opinion, the 2004 Act prohibited DIY work by requiring restricted building work to be only done by, or supervised by, a licensed building practitioner. The Government has previously argued that the Act did not restrict DIY work, whereas this bill proposes to water down the previous very strict interpretation of restricted building work and allow it to be defined by regulation.  Furthermore, we have concerns about the practicality of the very complex licensed building practitioners regime and while the bill is an improvement, we still oppose this aspect.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We believe that the bill gives the Government wider powers to bill councils for accreditation and auditing them as a building consent authority. This bill shifts the system from one of fixed fees by regulation to full cost recovery; this cost-shifting by central to local government will inevitably drive up rates.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The bill creates a new definition of large dam, dangerous dam, earthquake-prone dam, and flood-prone dam, and sets additional requirements for a dam safety assurance programme.  While these were supported by local authorities, engineers, and energy companies, concern was voiced regarding compliance costs for farms.</text>
