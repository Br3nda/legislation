        <para>
          <text>New Zealand has a comprehensive set of laws designed to protect children and families from violence and abuse. These include laws to protect the victims of domestic violence, laws to determine who should have the day-to-day care of a child, laws to prevent the removal of a child from New Zealand where this may disrupt their care arrangements, and laws to protect a child who is the subject of an application for adoption.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>However, issues have been identified with current legislation that restrict the ability of the State to protect the welfare and best interests of children and their families. New Zealand continues to have high rates of domestic violence. In 2007, 6 400 children were involved in applications for protection orders. Most of these children had witnessed violence and some had been subjected to violence directly. Children are harmed by seeing, hearing, or living with violence in the home. Exposure to psychological abuse can be as damaging as any other form of violence. Children who have experienced violence may suffer from increased emotional and behavioural problems, and impaired social skills.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There has also been an increase in the international movement of children for adoption purposes. This activity creates a risk that children will be adopted when they do not need to be and without appropriate safeguards.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is critical that the courts can act to protect children and families from all kinds of violence and abuse. There is a need to ensure that court processes are effective, that the protection provided by court orders is clear, administrative barriers are minimised, and that the Family Courts are able to manage concurrent proceedings involving children appropriately.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is important to address the risk of children being wrongfully removed from New Zealand. Current powers are inadequate to deal with the modern day international movement of children for adoption purposes. New provisions are required to fulfil New Zealand’s commitment to protecting the welfare and best interests of children, and to make it easier to prosecute offences relating to intercountry adoptions.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Main changes to existing law</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill proposes amendments to the Domestic Violence Act 1995 (the <emphasis style="bold">DVA</emphasis>), the Care of Children Act 2004 (the <emphasis style="bold">COCA</emphasis>), and the Adoption Act 1955. Consequential amendments are made to the Summary Proceedings Act 1957, the Extradition Act 1999, and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1992.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Amendments to Domestic Violence Act 1995</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The proposed amendments to the DVA relate to providing greater protection for child victims of domestic violence and to improving court processes.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Providing better protection for child victims of domestic violence</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill makes it clear that a protection order applies for the benefit of a child of an applicant until the age of 17, unless the order is sooner discharged. It allows a young person reaching the age of 17 who knows they will no longer be protected to apply to the Court for the order to continue for their benefit until they no longer live with the applicant or until the order is discharged.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The DVA is currently silent on whether children covered by a protection order remain covered by that order when the applicant dies. A person’s death will put grieving family members under stress, and confusion over legal requirements at this time is particularly distressing. The Bill therefore clarifies that a protection order that has not lapsed or been discharged continues for the benefit of any child of a deceased applicant until the age of 17.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill inserts in the DVA a provision to allow that, where a Family Court is dealing with an application under the DVA, it may make interim orders relating to a child’s care or vary existing orders even though no application has been filed. This provision is currently contained in the Care of Children Act 2004 where it may be overlooked if an application regarding care of a child isn't also being considered. The Bill also ensures that any lawyer appointed to act for a child under the Care of Children Act 2004 is explicitly allowed to be present at a hearing of proceedings under the DVA.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Most protection orders prohibit contact between the respondent and the children covered by the order. Some respondents claim that orders made on a without notice basis unfairly deny them contact with their children. Issues of contact with children can become a focus of dispute and have the potential to cause an escalation in hostility between partners. Evidence also indicates that children can benefit from continued contact with both parents. In response, and to ensure a focus on the best interests of the child, the Family Courts have adopted a practice of reviewing contact arrangements within a few weeks after a temporary order is made. The Bill codifies this practice, providing the Courts with the discretion to offer a review of the care arrangements which takes place only if both parents attend or are represented.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Changes to court processes and procedures</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Ensuring that respondents engage in a stopping violence programme is a critical aspect of New Zealand’s system that attempts to stop and prevent domestic violence. It is therefore important to minimise all administrative barriers to engagement in programmes. Currently, only a Judge can direct attendance at a programme. This process can become problematic if the respondent has not been served with a copy of the protection order containing the direction prior to the date specified for his or her first attendance at a programme. The Bill therefore enables the Registrar to amend the direction to require attendance at a later time.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill also provides amendments to ensure that when any temporary order becomes final by the operation of law after 3 months, the final order comes into effect immediately. This avoids any opportunity for a gap that could result in protected persons having no protection. The Bill also addresses the uncertainty that has arisen about whether a Judge needs to specifically discharge a temporary protection order when making a final protection order.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Amendments to Care of Children Act 2004</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>One of the inconsistencies between the DVA and the CoCA is that psychological abuse is explicitly provided for in the DVA, but not in the CoCA. The CoCA contains specific provisions which prescribe the way in which the Court must deal with care and contact arrangements where physical and sexual abuse is alleged; they do not apply to allegations of psychological abuse. The Bill amends the CoCA by providing that where a protection order has been made against a party to an application for a parenting order, the Court may only make an order allowing that party day-to-day care, or contact with, a child if the Court is satisfied that the child will be safe. If the Court is not satisfied that the child will be safe, it may make an order for supervised contact between the child and the party. This ensures that where a protection order has been made on the ground of psychological abuse, children who have been subject to, or witnessed, that abuse will be afforded additional protection.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Decisions under the CoCA are made in accordance with the welfare and best interests of the child having regard to the relevant principles in section 5. Section 5(e) states that a child must be protected from all forms of violence. The Bill amends this section to adopt the definition of violence in the DVA to clarify that all forms of violence means physical, sexual, and psychological abuse.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill also strengthens the protection for children at risk of unlawful removal from New Zealand. The restriction in section 77 of the CoCA to situations involving imminent risk of removal has been removed in order to protect children in cases where the risk of removal may not be <quote.in quote="1">imminent</quote.in>. The Bill will enable orders preventing removal to be more flexible by specifying that the child can travel overseas with a specified person or persons. It will also allow for the suspension of orders for a set period of time (currently parties must discharge orders and apply for new orders). This could, for example, allow a child to travel overseas to attend a family wedding or funeral.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Amendments to the Adoption Act 1955</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Adoption Act 1955 contains important procedural protections to safeguard children who are the subject of an application to adopt. Section 27(1)(d) of the Adoption Act 1955 makes it an offence for any person to give or receive any payment or reward in consideration of the adoption or proposed adoption of a child, or in consideration of making the arrangements for the adoption or proposed adoption, subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions relate to the payment of hospital and medical expenses, payments made to approved adoption agencies, and payments made pursuant to a court order. The offence is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 3 months or a fine up to $15,000, or both.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>However, this offence does not enable New Zealand to fulfil its international obligations to protect children and they are inadequate to deal with the modern day international movement of children for adoption purposes. Firstly, the offence carries a very low penalty of 3 months' imprisonment, which means that it is not an extraditable offence. Second, the provisions of New Zealand law require part of the offence to occur in New Zealand. Further, the penalties currently available under the Adoption Act 1955 are not severe enough to take into account the grave nature of the offence and are not commensurate with other penalties available for similar offences.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill includes a new offence under the Adoption Act 1955 of improperly inducing consent for the adoption of a child to be punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 7 years. The purpose of the proposed amendment is to ensure that New Zealand legislation fully complies with the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography so that it may be ratified.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Consequential amendments are also made to the Extradition Act 1999 and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1992, to ensure that New Zealand can carry out its international obligations in relation to the Optional Protocol. A consequential amendment is also made to the Summary Proceedings Act 1957.</text>

Under section 77, an order can be made preventing the removal of a child. Currently, an order can only be made if it is believed on reasonable grounds that a person is about to take a child out of New Zealand. This is a high threshold and does not acknowledge that the risk of removal may not be immediate, but is nonetheless real and ongoing. Section 77 is amended to lower this threshold and enable an order to be made when there are reasonable grounds to believe that a person may take a child out of New Zealand. Rather than a blanket prohibition on removal, the amendment affords flexibility to enable an order to name persons with whom a child may leave New Zealand.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Despite a comprehensive set of laws designed to protect women, children, and men from violence and abuse, New Zealand continues to have high rates of domestic violence, affecting thousands of New Zealanders from all cultures, backgrounds and circumstances. During the 13 years of operation of the Domestic Violence Act 1995 (<emphasis style="bold">DVA</emphasis>), concerns have been raised about the need to strengthen the ability of the DVA to achieve its object of reducing and preventing domestic violence, and providing victims with effective legal protection. Legislative amendment is underway in regard to strengthening the responsiveness of the criminal justice system to victims of domestic violence in the Domestic Violence (Enhancing Safety) Bill. Further amendments are required to protect children and families from violence and abuse. Concerns have also been raised regarding the need to update powers in the Care of Children Act 2004 (<emphasis style="bold">CoCA</emphasis>) restricting children being wrongfully removed from New Zealand and the powers available to deal with the modern day international movement of children for adoption purposes. New Zealand is among a minority of countries that have not ratified the Optional Protocol on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (the <emphasis style="bold">Optional Protocol</emphasis>), as part of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (<emphasis style="bold">UNCROC</emphasis>).</text>

          <text>New Zealand is committed to protecting the welfare and best interests of children. This goal lies at the centre of New Zealand family law legislation including the DVA and the CoCA. New Zealand is a party to UNCROC, but is among a minority of countries that have not ratified the Optional Protocol.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Despite a comprehensive set of laws designed to protect children and families from violence and abuse, New Zealand continues to have high rates of domestic violence, affecting thousands of New Zealanders from all cultures, backgrounds, and circumstances. For example, Police responded to 82 692 domestic violence incidents in 2008. Although it is difficult to measure, the social and economic cost of domestic violence is significant, both for victims experiencing violence, and for children who witness it. Offending inflicts emotional harm, serious physical injury, and death.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Children are often the victims of physical and sexual abuse in the home. Lifetime estimates of child abuse suggest 4–10% of New Zealand children experience physical abuse, and 24% of girls and 11% of boys experience sexual abuse. Children are also harmed by seeing, hearing, or living with violence in the home. In 2007, 6 400 children were involved in applications for protection orders. Most of these children have witnessed violence and some have been subjected to violence directly. Children who have experienced violence may suffer from increased emotional and behavioural problems, and impaired social skills.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Although there is a general consensus that the principles of the DVA are sound, concerns raised with the Ministry of Justice about particular aspects of the DVA during its 13 years of operation indicated a need for further examination and consultation. Many concerns related to the need to strengthen the ability of the DVA to achieve its object of reducing and preventing domestic violence, and providing victims with effective legal protection. This strengthening requires legislative reform in order to improve the way the DVA operates. Further non-legislative reform is being undertaken including improvements to law enforcement procedures.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Some of these concerns regarding legislative reform are being met through the Domestic Violence (Enhancing Safety) Bill currently before Parliament. This Bill focuses on providing adequate protection for victims through an appropriately strong enforcement response, especially at the time that Police are called to a domestic violence incident. It also enhances the response of criminal courts to domestic violence.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There are also a number of technical concerns regarding the implementation of the DVA that have been raised by the judiciary and Court staff. These include the treatment of temporary orders and the ability for a Registrar to amend the date and time of a direction to attend a programme when a direction has not been served before the start of that programme.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There remain other concerns that the DVA does not provide an adequately balanced approach to issues relating to children, and that provisions relating to children, between the DVA and the CoCA could be better aligned. Examples include respondents’ access to their children, especially where access is denied after the issue of a temporary protection order (issued without notice to the respondent); and the interface between the DVA and the CoCA relating to parenting orders and issues of psychological abuse. Finally the DVA also lacks clarity about whether a protection order continues for the benefit of children after they reach 17 years of age, or in situations where the applicant dies.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Issues have also been identified regarding the legal framework set out in the CoCA for dealing with the wrongful removal of children from New Zealand. Wrongfully removing children from New Zealand disrupts care arrangements and puts children at risk of harm. There is a particular interest in preventing further harm to children in cases which involve violence. The proposals in the Bill enhance the current framework to reduce the risk of wrongful removal.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Issues have also been raised that New Zealand has yet to ratify the Optional Protocol. The Optional Protocol aims to enhance the international legal protection for children from sexual and other forms of exploitation by requiring State Parties to prohibit various activities associated with the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography, whether they are committed domestically or transnationally. The Optional Protocol also deals with issues which arise from the commission of or conviction for these offences.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Optional Protocol was signed by New Zealand in September 2000, at which time the Ministry of Justice was directed to identify the extent of legislative change that would be required before New Zealand could ratify the Optional Protocol. Since that time, a number of legislative amendments have been made to ensure that New Zealand’s domestic law complies with the Optional Protocol. However, one legislative amendment remains before New Zealand can ratify—an offence with extraterritorial application that prohibits improperly inducing consent to the adoption of a child.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The purpose of adoption law is to provide a child who cannot be cared for by his or her own parents with a permanent family life. The Adoption Act 1955 contains important procedural protections to safeguard children who are the subject of an application to adopt. Generally speaking, a child cannot be adopted without the consent of the child’s parents. Section 27(1)(d) of the Adoption Act 1955 makes it an offence for any person to give or receive any payment or reward in consideration of the adoption or proposed adoption of a child or in consideration of making the arrangements for the adoption or proposed adoption, subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions relate to the payment of hospital and medical expenses, payments made to approved adoption agencies, and payments made pursuant to a court order. The offence is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 3 months or a fine up to $15,000, or both.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There has been an increase in the international movement of children for adoption purposes. This movement creates a risk that children will be adopted when they do not need to be and without appropriate safeguards. The offence provisions in the Adoption Act 1955 are currently inadequate to deal with the modern day international movement of children for adoption purposes. Because of the low penalty (3 months), the offence is not extraditable. The Extradition Act 1999 requires an extradition offence to be punishable by 12 months' imprisonment. In addition, the offence does not have extraterritorial effect, as the provisions require part of the offence to occur in New Zealand. This prevents New Zealand authorities from prosecuting this offence in New Zealand where it has occurred overseas and New Zealand does not extradite the offender.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There is also concern that the existing penalties, in particular the term of imprisonment, are not severe enough to take into account the grave nature of the offence. For instance, similar offences in Australia and Canada carry terms of imprisonment of up to 2 years. Further, the penalties currently available under the Adoption Act 1955 are not commensurate with other penalties available for similar offences. Under section 105C of the Crimes Act 1961, bribery of a foreign public official is an offence punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 7 years. As such, under the current regime, there is a disconnect in that inducing a foreign individual to consent to an adoption carries a far less severe penalty than bribing foreign officials for other, arguably less destructive, purposes.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The above issues raise concerns about the effectiveness of the current provisions in the DVA, the CoCA, and the Adoption Act 1955 that affect all parties—victims, respondents, and children, as well as the Police and the court system. Keeping the status quo exposes all of these key stakeholders to levels of risk that will be minimised by the reform proposals.</text>

          <text>In each case where legislative reform is proposed, regulation is viewed as providing the best way to achieve the desired policy objectives and non-regulatory options are considered to provide a less effective response.</text>

          <text>The public domestic violence discussion document <emphasis style="italic">A Review of the Domestic Violence Act 1995 and Related Legislation</emphasis> sets out a range of regulatory options for some reform proposals. These alternative regulatory measures were discounted after careful consideration of the issues and after consultation. Many offered a weak or partial solution, especially in terms of victim safety. Other options did not adequately balance the rights of all parties.</text>

          <text>Ratification of the Optional Protocol cannot be achieved without the creation of a new offence in the Adoption Act 1955. Current legislation falls short of the requirements of the Optional Protocol because the existing offence is not extraditable, does not have extraterritorial effect, and the penalties are not severe enough to take into account the grave nature of the offence.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The reforms will increase protection for private individuals, especially children, who are victims of domestic violence. Alignment between the CoCA and the DVA will be achieved by providing for a protection order made on the grounds of psychological abuse to trigger the supervised contact provisions and ensuring that the parenting order provisions in the CoCA refer to the definition of violence set out in the DVA. Continued protection order cover will be provided for the children of deceased applicants, while the reforms will provide clarity that cover will end for any child included on a protected persons order once they turn 17 years of age, unless an application is made to the Court for their continued protection. Provisions to prevent the wrongful removal of children will promote children’s safety and ensure the consistency of care arrangements.</text>

          <text>One hundred and three submissions were received from a wide range of stakeholders, including individuals, community organisations, and government agencies, in response to a public domestic violence discussion document released in December 2007. The domestic violence discussion document invited comment on preliminary proposals. Proposals for reform were consulted on widely within government, and with a variety of NGOs, taking these submissions into account. Many of the proposals in the Domestic Violence Reform Bill that did not appear in the Domestic Violence (Enhancing Safety) Bill were raised in submissions to the Justice and Electoral Committee during its consideration of the latter Bill.</text>
