        <heading>Introduction</heading>
        <para>
          <text>The Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Amendment Bill (No 4) is a Government Bill that amends the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989 and the Criminal Justice Act 1985.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>After the bill was referred to the committee the Minister of Social Development produced a Supplementary Order Paper which detailed suggested responses to reports of child abuse. Submitters on the bill were invited to comment on it.</text>

        <para>
          <text>This commentary focuses on the main issues raised by submitters.</text>

        <heading>Arrest, bail, and custody issues</heading>
        <para>
          <text>Currently, the police cannot arrest a young person for failing to comply with bail conditions imposed by the Youth Court, as non-compliance is not an offence. We consider that clauses 7 and 12 will enable the police to take a young person who is breaching court-ordered bail conditions (using such force as may be necessary) and return them to a state of compliance. It will also empower the police to arrest a young person, without warrant, for breaching their bail conditions where the police consider that use of the power to take and return the young person is inappropriate in the circumstances.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Several submitters raised concerns that these clauses would give the police too much power to arrest children and young people, which would contravene the rights of young people and the underlying principle of the Act. The underlying principle of the Act is that young people be dealt with outside of the criminal justice system wherever possible, using the least restrictive means appropriate.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The submitters are correct in seeing the amendments in these clauses as extending the police's  ability to arrest without warrant. However, only young persons subject to court-ordered bail conditions are exposed to the risk. We consider that this limited application of the extended right of arrest is justified given the need to promote bail as a credible alternative to detention in custody. We also note that the alternative approach would be to make breaching court-ordered bail conditions an offence in its own right. However, this would severely constrain the ability of the police to react flexibly to minor or accidental infringements of bail conditions.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A submitter pointed out that in the event that the power in new section 243A is not exercised, it is unclear exactly where the child or young person will be placed.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There is lack of clarity about where to place a young person arrested for breach of bail. We consider it is necessary to give the Department of Child, Youth and Family Services and the police the ability to detain a young person in custody for breaching bail conditions.</text>
        </para>
        <comm.lev2>
          <heading>Merging clauses 7 and 12</heading>
          <para>
            <text>The New Zealand Police Association submitted that clauses 7 and 12 addressing control of power of arrest for breaching bail conditions be merged into a single clause. They argued that the use of two separate sections for this purpose is confusing and overly complicated. The fact that the two sections are so far apart in the Act adds to the confusion. We agree that clauses 7 and 12 should be merged.</text>

        <heading>Family Group Conferences</heading>
        <para>
          <text>The purpose of clauses 13, 21, and 22 is to extend the circumstances in which a Family Group Conference (FGC) can be waived, and to simplify the structure and language of the current section 248 of the Act which governs this power. Some submitters argued that these clauses fail to simplify section 248 and that it remains unnecessarily long and complicated.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We agree but note that the complexity reflects the fact that these clauses are situation-specific. The power to waive an FGC will remain limited to circumstances where their prior offending has not been dealt with or the young person is subject to an existing custodial sentence or order for other offending.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The current wording in the bill extends the grounds for waiving a FGC to include:</text>

          <text>We propose that the power to waive an FGC be changed from a tightly prescribed power, to a generic, judgment-based power.

        <heading>Discretion to exclude entitled persons from a Family Group Conference</heading>
        <para>
          <text>Clause 14 provides discretion to exclude certain relatives or caregivers from attending an FGC where their presence may endanger the safety of the young person and disrupt the FGC. However, this clause as drafted does not adequately emphasise the safety aspect or the needs of the people entitled to attend an FGC, including the victim or their support people. We consider that the extension of the provision being sought would give better effect to victims' rights, consistent with other amendments in the bill.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Some submitters argued for a greater role for youth advocates in FGCs. They argue that the youth advocate is central to ensuring that young people can play a full role in the proceedings, and participate in decisions relating to their own accountability and needs. The appointment of youth advocates is not addressed in the bill. Certain operational matters relating to the use of youth advocates in FGCs need further consideration before a policy for their systematic use can be developed and implemented. A decision to do this does not require changes to the Act.</text>

        <heading>Enforcement of reparation orders from the Family Court</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We propose a new clause recommending the enforcement of reparation orders from the Family Court. Youth offending is generally dealt with under Part IV (Youth Justice) of the Act, and where necessary in the Youth Court. However, when the offending of children aged 10 to 13 is such as to give serious concern for their wellbeing, they may be dealt with in the Family Court by way of an application for a declaration that they are in need of care or protection (the application is brought on the ground in section 14(1)(e) in Part II (Care and Protection) of the Act). On making a declaration on this ground, the Family Court may make orders under section 84 of the Act in respect of the children's  offending. One such order is for reparation against children or their parents or guardians under section 84(1)(b).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Currently, there is no express provision in the Act for the enforcement of section 84 orders, and they can be enforced only in the same manner as a civil judgment. Where the offender or their family complies with the reparation order, no issues arise. Non-compliance cannot readily be addressed through civil enforcement without re-victimising the victim, for example, by requiring them to take part in proceedings to establish the debtor's  means to pay.</text>

          <heading>Timeframes for <quote.in quote="1">laying an information</quote.in></heading>
          <para>
            <text>Clause 19 will permit <quote.in quote="1">an information to be laid</quote.in> – that is, a young person to be charged and required to come before the Court – outside of the current six-month timeframe in certain circumstances. It would apply if a young person had failed to comply with a decision, recommendation or plan of a Family Group Conference (FGC).</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>A proposed amendment will eliminate the <quote.in quote="1">need</quote.in> for an <quote.in quote="1">information to be laid</quote.in> requirement in anticipation of a young person failing to comply with a plan outside of the current six month time limit. The amendment will also encourage the use of an FGC where there is little time remaining in the initial six-month window for the <quote.in quote="1">laying of an information</quote.in> and the police might otherwise go directly to the Youth Court. A key benefit of this amendment is that it will keep young people out of the Court, while also enabling follow-up action to hold them accountable for their offending behaviour if the FGC outcome is not complied with.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The policy intent of this clause is that the power should apply in situations where non-compliance is serious, and that the Youth Court should regulate the definition of what constitutes legitimate grounds for <quote.in quote="1">laying an information</quote.in> after an alleged failure to complete an FGC plan or outcome.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>A submitter pointed out that the clause applies to all offences, not just those covered by section 14 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957. To avoid doubt, the proposed amendment applies only where the six-month time limit currently applies. The use of an FGC is <quote.in quote="1">rewarded</quote.in> in these cases by <quote.in quote="1">re-setting the clock</quote.in> to zero once the FGC has been held, to allow six months for alternative action to be implemented and completed. We have proposed amendments to this clause to reinstate the original policy intent.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>We disagree with a submitter who suggested that the current wording of clause 19, by introducing the new test of <quote.in quote="1">significance</quote.in>, has the unintended result of creating a two-tier compliance regime and the potential for technical defences. The policy intent is that further proceedings should be limited to failures to comply with the FGC decisions, recommendations, or plans in a significant way; that is, when a young person has failed to comply with the requirements of an FGC in more than a minor way. We propose to replace the words <quote.in quote="1">significant way</quote.in> with the words <quote.in quote="1">material particular</quote.in>. These are words found elsewhere in the Act to refer to a child or young person's  failure to comply with a particular aspect of an agreed plan in a material way.</text>

          <heading>Application for arrest warrant on breach of supervision</heading>
          <para>
            <text>The original intention of the Act was that the Court should be able to act on an application made before, or soon after, the expiry of a supervision/community work order, in cases where there has been a failure to comply with the order. Current Youth Court interpretation of the Act means that:</text>

                <para>
                  <text>there is no leeway to submit an application to cancel and replace an order soon after expiry if serious non-compliance is revealed.</text>

          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Further, under the new sections 320A and 320B, the Youth Court will be empowered to issue a warrant for the arrest of a young person who has failed to comply with an order at the same time as the application to breach the order is made. This would occur only after all reasonable efforts had been made to locate the young person and serve the application.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The clauses as drafted do not state clearly that an application lodged on time can still be addressed by the Youth Court if the process of consideration results in the original expiry date being reached. We propose to amend clause 28 to make explicit the Youth Court's  power to do so, consistent with the policy intent informing the amendment.</text>

            <text>The application and enforcement provisions do not allow for practical implementation, particularly where the order is not supervised by a social worker or police officer, and in situations where the young person has left the district where the warrant is issued.

          <para>
            <text>The Act currently recognises the interests of victims. However, this recognition is not adequately reflected in the youth justice principles of the Act in section 208(g), which provide only that <quote.in quote="1">due regard</quote.in> should be given to the interests of victims. The bill amends the Act to reinforce the existing youth justice principle of recognising properly the interests of the victim. We agree it is not the policy intention to detract from the central position of the young person in the process while recognizing the interests of victims.</text>

            <text>Several submitters argued that clause 6 was too weak.

          <heading>Scope for reparation</heading>
          <para>
            <text>The Sentencing Act 2002 repealed section 22(5) of the Criminal Justice Act 1985, which provided that reparation could not extend to consequential loss or damage. A similar amendment to the equivalent provision in the youth justice jurisdiction (section 287 of the Act) was not made at that time, which means that reparation in the youth jurisdiction is limited to the cost of replacement or repair. Consequently, a victim's entitlement to reparation varies depending on whether an offender is sentenced in the youth or the adult jurisdiction.</text>

          <para>
            <text>Clauses 2, 24(1) and 26 correct this anomaly by amending section 283(f) of the Act to enable the Youth Court to order reparation for loss or damage consequent on any emotional or physical harm, or loss of or damage to property.</text>

          <para>
            <text>In the youth jurisdiction, information on reparation is obtained in an unstructured way through the FGC process. Current practice fails to ensure that the offender or his or her family does not promise more than they can reasonably pay, resulting in unrealistic expectations. Unrealistic reparation expectations undermine effective practice. We suggest a new policy to allow specific reports to be requested from social workers on reparation matters in order to improve practice.</text>
