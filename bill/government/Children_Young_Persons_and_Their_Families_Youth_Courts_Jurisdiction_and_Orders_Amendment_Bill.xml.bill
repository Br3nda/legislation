          <text>The Social Services Committee has examined the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families (Youth Courts Jurisdiction and Orders) Amendment Bill and recommends by majority that it be passed with the amendments shown.</text>

        <heading>Introduction</heading>
        <para>
          <text>The Children, Young Persons, and Their Families (Youth Courts Jurisdiction and Orders) Amendment Bill is intended to strengthen the response to serious offending by children and young people, and targets a group of approximately 1,000 serious and persistent young offenders.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The bill as introduced would amend the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989 to extend the Youth Court’s jurisdiction to cover the most serious 12- and 13-year-old offenders, and to allow a wider range of sentencing orders to be made for dealing with offenders. These orders would be tailored to the individual offender, and could include a requirement to attend a rehabilitative or education programme, such as a parenting programme, mentoring programme, or alcohol and drug rehabilitation programme.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Most of our recommended amendments do not propose substantive changes to the bill, but address some significant omissions, improve its clarity, and clarify its intent.</text>

        <heading>Wider Youth Court jurisdiction</heading>
        <para>
          <text>While we are aware of some concern about the transfer of some child offenders to the jurisdiction of the Youth Court, the majority of us consider that this proposal is sound. Indeed, we note that our youth justice system, with its specified principles and objectives, diversionary nature, and family-based decision-making processes, would still ensure that 12- and 13-year-olds would be dealt with appropriately to their age. As the bill would allow for a dual pathway for serious child offenders, a Youth Court judge might decide that it would be more appropriate for the child to be dealt with as a care and protection matter by the Family Court. We were advised that a very small number (less than 100) of 12- and 13-year-olds would be dealt with by the Youth Court, because the bill defines serious offending in a way that captures only the most serious child offenders, and it includes important protections for them; for example, 12- and 13-year-olds would be protected from spending time in a youth justice residence where possible, and the <emphasis style="italic">doli incapax</emphasis><footnote id="DLM2581863"><para><text> The <emphasis style="italic">doli incapax</emphasis> rule requires the Court to be satisfied that the offender knew that the act or omission constituting the offence was wrong and unlawful. It applies in care and protection proceedings (section 198 of the principal Act), and before a child aged 10 to 13 years old can be convicted (section 22 of the Crimes Act 1961).</text></para></footnote> rule would still apply to children appearing before the Youth Court.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>However, we believe that some small amendments to the provisions regarding the Youth Court’s jurisdiction over child offenders are necessary to improve their clarity and reflect the policy intent. We therefore recommend amendments to clauses 10, 11, 13, and 39 (discussed further below).</text>
        </para>
        <comm.lev2>
          <heading>Previous offending</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend that new section 272(1B) (inserted by clause 10) be deleted so that offending admitted at a family group conference would not of itself expose young offenders to the Youth Court’s jurisdiction. We were concerned that new section 272(1B), which would allow a child offender to be defined as a previous offender if he or she admits at a family group conference to offending, might allow a family group conference to be used to expose 12- and 13-year-olds to the Youth Court’s jurisdiction for future offending. We consider that this is undesirable, and that using admissions of offending from an informal setting such as a family group conference, to potentially expose a child to Youth Court jurisdiction for any subsequent offending would be unjustified for a number of reasons, including the potential absence of legal representation for the child at a family group conference. We consider it preferable to rely only on offending proven before the Family Court or other Court to initiate involvement with the Youth Court.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>To correct an omission, we also recommend inserting new section 272(1A) and (1B) to specify that a <quote.in quote="1">previous offender</quote.in> also includes cases where a 12- or 13-year-old has previously been convicted of murder or manslaughter in the High Court, or convicted in the High Court or a District Court for offences punishable by a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison. While such cases are extremely rare, we believe there should nonetheless be provision for them should they come before the courts. We also recommend that a child be defined as a previous offender where an offence punishable by a maximum sentence of 14 years or more imprisonment is proved against him or her before a Youth Court.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>We also recommend that wherever the bill refers to a maximum penalty available that is or includes imprisonment for at least 10 or 14 years, this should be amended to also include reference to imprisonment for life. This would recognise that some serious offences do not specify a maximum penalty as a determinate number of years of imprisonment, and clarify which offenders are intended to be captured by the bill.</text>

          <heading>Transfer of charges to other courts</heading>
          <para>
            <text>While we note that election of trial by jury by a child, and thereby trial in a District or High Court, is very rare, we consider that this process requires clarification to reflect more accurately the policy intent in this area. In particular, the intention is that 12- and 13-year-olds could not be sent to these courts for trial except for murder or manslaughter, although a 12- or 13-year-old might elect trial by jury for any offence for which an adult may or must be tried by jury. It is also intended that, until a 12- or 13-year-old was committed for trial, the child could still elect to be tried in the Youth Court. For this reason, we recommend that new section 272A in clause 11 be amended to clarify that sections 273 to 276 (concerning transfer of charges from the Youth Court prior to a trial) would not apply to children aged 12 or 13 years who were charged with a serious offence other than murder or manslaughter, but that the following provisions would apply:</text>

                  <text>Regardless of whether the offence was a purely indictable offence, the Youth Court would be required to hear and determine the information unless the child elected trial by jury or the Court discharged the information under section 282 of the principal Act.</text>

                  <text>Where the Court was required to or intended to commit the child for trial, or where the child wished to plead guilty at any time before committal to trial, the Court would be required (until it committed the child for trial) to continue to allow the child the opportunity to forego jury trial and elect to have the information heard and determined, or be dealt with, by the Youth Court.</text>

            </list>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>We also recommend that clause 11 be amended to make it clear that section 282(1) would apply as if it empowered the Youth Court to discharge an information charging the child with an offence even if it were a purely indictable offence.</text>

          <heading>Judicial powers</heading>
          <para>
            <text>New section 280A in clause 13 of the bill would allow the Youth Court to refer a charge back to the Police or other informant if the Court believed that the matter should be dealt with by the Family Court. In its present form, the section could be interpreted to allow an informant to consider and report back to the Youth Court that continuation of the Youth Court proceedings would serve the public interest better than an application for a declaration (contrary to the Youth Court judge’s decision), and would therefore allow Youth Court proceedings to resume. We recommend several amendments to new subsections (2) and (4) to make it clear that an informant could not recommend that the case continue to proceed in the Youth Court in response to a referral, as this is not the intent of the referral power. We consider that these amendments would ensure new section 280A and the role of the informant were clearer and conformed more closely to the policy intent, which is to allow an informant the opportunity to begin child offender proceedings in the Family Court or deal with the matter in a different way.</text>

          <heading>Detaining child offenders in Police custody</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We are aware that the way in which the bill is currently drafted could allow children to be detained in Police custody for an indefinite period. We note that currently there are limited circumstances in which a child who is arrested, or ordered by the Youth Court to be in the custody of the chief executive, may be detained in Police custody for no more than 24 hours after arrest, and we believe these powers are sufficient; it should not be desirable or necessary to detain children in the custody of the Police for open-ended periods. We therefore consider that the bill should clarify this matter, and recommend that new clause 5A be inserted to specify that a child cannot be detained in Police custody by a Youth Court order pending a hearing or determination of charges against them. Additionally, we recommend inserting new clause 5B to provide that a child or young person can be detained in the custody of the chief executive or an iwi social service pending the determination of an application for breach (or variation or cancellation) of orders.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>For further clarification, we also recommend that clause 11 be amended to make it clear that sections 236, 238(1)(e), 239(2), 242(2), and 365(1) of the principal Act, relating to Police custody and placements in a residence, do not apply to a child as if the child were a young person.</text>

          <heading>Placing child offenders in residences</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend that clause 39 be amended to specify that it relates to placements of 12- and 13-year-olds in youth justice residences only. Clause 39 amends section 365 of the principal Act, and requires the chief executive to consider, before placing a young offender aged 12 or 13 years in a residence, all reasonably practicable less restrictive alternatives. The intent of the clause is, where possible, to protect 12- and 13-year-olds from placement in youth justice residences, where they may be exposed to harmful influences or victimised by older offenders. We believe that this amendment would remove any ambiguity about the purpose of the clause.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>We also recommend that clause 39 be amended to provide a definition of a youth justice residence. We recommend further amendments to this clause and to new clause 39A to make it clear that sections 365 and 366 of the principal Act (dealing with the closing of residences and transfer of residents) are subject to section 312, which requires the Court’s approval for placement in a residence, and transfer between residences, of a young person in the chief executive’s custody under a supervision with residence order.</text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Breaching, varying, and cancelling orders</heading>
        <para>
          <text>As introduced, new sections 296A to 296C in clause 21 detail standard provisions for breach and variation or cancellation of orders. We believe that these provisions require substantial amendment to improve their clarity and allow more immediate responses should an offender fail to comply with curfew provisions of an intensive supervision order, or if a specified order needed to be varied or suspended. We consider that these amendments would also reduce delays in bringing proceedings for curfew breaches serious enough to warrant the arrest of the offender.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We therefore recommend that these provisions be amended to empower the Youth Court to issue arrest warrants for young offenders who fail to appear on breach applications (including offenders who cannot be served with the application or located); suspend the operation of an order at any time after an application under new sections 296B or 296C of the principal Act is made and before the disposal of that application; and make bail or custody orders under section 238 of the principal Act when an order is suspended. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>For the same reasons, we also recommend inserting new section 296HA to empower the Police or a social worker to detain a young offender for the purpose of returning them to the applicable curfew address; and to empower the Police to arrest without a warrant a young offender who is in breach of curfew.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend one further amendment to new section 296A in relation to breaches of parenting orders. We consider that all consequences of failing to comply with Court orders should be found in the same place; so new section 296A should specify that young offenders who fail to comply with parenting education programme orders will be subject to the breach procedures laid out in new section 296B. In addition, we consider that it should also be specified that section 296B, and other provisions allowing the Youth Court to substitute orders in response to breaches of orders, are subject to new section 289, which requires the Court to impose the least restrictive outcome adequate to the circumstances.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Lastly, we recommend two consequential amendments as a result of the proposed new warrant powers, inserting new clauses 39B and 39C.</text>
        </para>
        <comm.lev2>
          <heading>Parenting education programme orders</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We believe that the phrase <quote.in quote="1">every child or young person affected by the order</quote.in> in new section 297A(4) of clause 22 as introduced does not communicate clearly enough the children or young people whose care or protection is to be considered by a family group conference that may be directed under this provision. We therefore recommend amending new section 297A to convey more clearly the policy intent of clause 22. This new section should specify that when a parent of an offender is subject to a parenting order, the young offender may be included in the referral for a family group conference. We also recommend making it clear that in situations where a young offender is ordered to attend a parenting programme and fails to comply, that although he or she would be subject to the breach conditions proposed in new section 296B, a family group conference referral could still be made in respect of the child of whom the offender is a parent, guardian, or caregiver. Additionally, we recommend that section 296C in clause 21 be amended to make it clear that provisions relating to varying and cancelling orders apply also to Court-ordered parenting education programme orders for the parents or guardians of a young person.</text>

          <heading>Intensive supervision orders</heading>
          <para>
            <text>The bill as introduced sets out a hierarchy of orders that a Youth Court could make, ranging from the least restrictive (group 1) to the most restrictive (group 7). However, it does not mention intensive supervision orders, as such an order cannot be made when a charge against a young person is proved before a Youth Court. We recommend inserting new section 289(2) in clause 19 to clarify that new section 289 (which specifies that the Court should impose the least restrictive outcome adequate to the circumstances) applies when the Court considers all the orders (including intensive supervision orders) it may make in response to a breach of a judicially monitored condition of a supervision or a supervision with activity order, and that intensive supervision orders be treated as a group 5 response. This would make an intensive supervision order equivalent to a supervision with activity order in the hierarchy.</text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Residential programmes</heading>
        <para>
          <text>Section 396 of the principal Act allows the chief executive to approve bodies or organisations as child and family support services, iwi social services, or cultural social services. These bodies or organisations are approved only if the chief executive believes that, among other things, they are appropriate to act as custodians or guardians of children or young people. As this bill proposes that young offenders may be required to attend a programme or activity under a supervision with residence order, we believe to protect young offenders in this situation adequately the bill should require clearly that all residential programmes must be approved under section 396 of the principal Act. We therefore recommend that new section 290A be inserted into clause 20 to specify this, and to clarify what is meant by a residential component of a programme or activity. Additionally, we recommend that clauses 25 and 28, regarding supervision with residence or activity orders, be consequentially amended to be subject to new section 290A.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We also recommend that new clause 39D be inserted to amend section 447 of the principal Act to allow regulations to be made to regulate the administration, management, and control of any residential component of a specified programme or activity that involves a residential component.</text>
        </para>
        <comm.lev2>
          <heading>Longer supervision with residence orders</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend minor amendments to clarify provisions relating to longer supervision with residence orders. Firstly, as military-style camps are likely to be an option for supervision with residence orders, we believe that the definition of <quote.in quote="1">residence</quote.in> should be widened to accommodate temporary camp arrangements; we therefore recommend inserting new clause 4A to make this amendment to the definition.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Secondly, we are aware that, as introduced, clause 28 of the bill could be interpreted to mean that a supervision order may be made only in cases in which the Court imposes a condition requiring a young person to take part in a programme or activity. As this is not the intention of the clause, we recommend amending new section 311(2) in clause 28 and inserting new section 311(2A), to make it very clear that making a supervision order following a supervision with residence order would not be limited to cases where a Court imposed further conditions.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>In addition, we recommend amending new section 289 in clause 20 (Court to impose least restrictive outcome adequate to the circumstances) so that it would apply to any order imposed by a Court under section 316 (which would empower the Court to cancel a supervision with residence order if the young person absconded). We also recommend inserting new clause 29A to make the necessary amendment to section 316.</text>

        <heading>Judicial monitoring</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We consider that clause 26, which sets out provisions relating to judicial monitoring, requires a slight amendment to capture better the range of young offenders to which it may apply. Currently, new section 308A in this clause states that young offenders who have previously been subject to a supervision or more restrictive order from the Youth Court, or have violated the conditions of a supervision or supervision with activity order, may be subject to judicial monitoring on some or all of the conditions of their supervision order. We recommend that new section 308A be amended to allow judicial monitoring of young offenders previously convicted in the District Court or the High Court and consequently sentenced to a community-based sentence, home detention, or imprisonment. While extending judicial monitoring in this way is likely to affect only a very small number of offenders, we consider that they should nonetheless be included.</text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Intensive supervision orders</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend a small amendment to clause 21 regarding intensive supervision orders. The bill as introduced would not give the Youth Court the power to impose on such an order a condition that an offender undertake a programme or activity. We consider that intensive supervision orders should be balanced with the power to require offenders to participate in beneficial activities and programmes. We therefore recommend that new section 296F of this clause be amended by inserting new subsections (e) and (f), which would empower the Youth Court to make an intensive supervision order subject to the offender taking part in any specified activity or programme.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We also consider that new section 296I(4)(b) in the same clause, dealing with reviewing and revising intensive supervision orders, requires amendment to clarify its meaning and ensure its wording is consistent with similar provisions in the principal Act. We therefore recommend amending this new section to require the Court to specify the inadequacies it requires to be addressed when it asks for a revised plan. For the same reasons, we recommend that new section 319A(5)(b) in clause 30, regarding reviews of orders for periods of at least 8 months, be similarly amended.</text>

        <heading>Technical amendments</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend a number of minor technical amendments to the bill.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>New section 283(o) in clause 15 would allow a young person over the age of 14 years against whom the charge proved was a purely indictable offence to be convicted by the Youth Court and transferred to the District Court for sentence or decision. We recommend amending new section 283(o)(ii) in clause 15, and consequentially, new section 285(6)(c)(ii) in clause 17, to clarify that they would not apply to young persons who had reached the age of 15 years. This would remove any ambiguity regarding the applicability of these sections to young people aged over 15 years.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Clause 12 amends section 274, and is intended to ensure that Part 5A of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 applies to committal proceedings in the Youth Court (clause 43 is, therefore, unnecessary). However, Part 5A of that Act allows Registrars to conduct a standard committal, although it was not intended for Registrars to do so in the Youth Court. We therefore recommend that section 274 of clause 12 be amended to make it explicit that Registrars are not empowered to conduct standard committal proceedings in the Youth Court.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We also recommend incorporating two provisions from the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Amendment Bill (No 6) amending sections 277 and 282 of the principal Act, which the previous committee supported during the last Parliament.<footnote id="DLM2581864"><para><text> At the time of our consideration of this bill, the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families (No 6) Amendment Bill was awaiting its second reading in Parliament.</text></para></footnote> These amendments relate to applicable provisions where a young person is charged jointly with an adult (and require that in cases where a young person is charged jointly with an adult for purely indictable offences, and in cases tried by a jury, the trial must be heard in a Youth Court), and would empower the Court to make certain orders before it discharges an information. Given the non-controversial but significant nature of these procedural provisions, we believe that they should be brought forward into this bill. These provisions are detailed in new clauses 12C and 14A respectively.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We also recommend that all references in this bill to <amend.in quote="1">preliminary hearings</amend.in> be replaced with <amend.in quote="1">committal proceedings</amend.in>. This would reflect the new committal procedure introduced by the Summary Proceedings Amendment Act 2008.</text>

          <heading>Military-style activity camps</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We are aware of concern that the proposed military-style activity camps envisioned by the Government as part of the new range of Youth Court orders under the bill would be inappropriate for the rehabilitation of young offenders, especially given the lack of detail available when the bill was sent to us for consideration earlier in the year about what such camps could entail. However, Government members are assured that these camps will not be similar to the corrective training <quote.in quote="1">boot camps</quote.in> that previously existed in New Zealand. Instead, they will be focused on improving life skills and literacy and numeracy, are likely to involve outdoor adventure or wilderness training, and in some cases may offer alcohol and drug rehabilitation. We understand that they would also involve some aspects of military training, similar to the Limited Service Volunteer scheme that is currently operating in Canterbury, and that some camps would potentially be located on New Zealand Defence Force bases around the country.</text>

          <heading>Further reform</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We are concerned that current Family Court processes for dealing with child offenders are too slow in many situations, and are aware that many stakeholders, such as the Police and social workers, share this concern. While we were informed that a judge could impose <quote.in quote="1">adjournment conditions</quote.in>, such as a curfew, a prohibition from certain geographic areas, and short-dated family group conferences, on an offender following his or her first Youth Court appearance, such powers are not available in the Family Court. In order to allay concerns about the speed of some Family Court processes, we believe that the Family Court should have these powers; however we understand that empowering the Family Court with these abilities is outside the scope of this particular bill.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Additionally, we also considered whether we could improve Family Court powers to deal better with a number of matters, but particularly how the Court deals with recidivist but low-level offenders, early intervention, and better streamlining its processes; but such issues are also outside the scope of this bill. However, we understand that the Government also holds concerns about this area of child offending, and may look to introduce some legislation in the near future to improve child offending processes in the Family Court.</text>

          <heading>Introduction</heading>
          <para>
            <text>New Zealand currently has a Youth Justice system that is both unique and internationally respected. Labour is concerned that some of the changes proposed in this bill will undermine our existing system, and are based on little to no evidence. We also believe this bill was a wasted opportunity. As many submitters noted, there are parts of the existing youth justice system that are overly complex, existing programmes that appear successful but are under-resourced, and there is very little information on the final outcomes for many of the young people moving through the system. These are issues which could have been addressed as part of this bill and debate, but were not.</text>

          <heading>Child offenders</heading>
          <para>
            <text>This bill enables proceedings to be commenced in the Youth Court against children aged 12 or 13 years who are alleged to have committed specified offences. The Chief Judge of the Youth Court, Judge Andrew Becroft, regarded this provision as <quote.in quote="1">constituting the most fundamental change to the system since its inception in 1989.</quote.in></text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Labour believes that very little justification was provided for such a substantive change. We maintain that the Family Court is best placed to deal with child offenders and associated care and protection issues. Judge Becroft also highlighted this point, stating that <quote.in quote="1">there is a real concern by Youth Court judges that the Court will be assuming responsibility for the worst child offenders, who by definition will have the most serious care and protection issues, yet the Youth Court will not have the necessary statutory ‘ammunition’ to deal with the inevitable care and protection issues at the root of offending.</quote.in></text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>During the select committee process Labour suggested that if there was a genuine concern around the lack of <quote.in quote="1">tools</quote.in> available to Family Court judges to deal with the most severe child offenders, the Government should look at granting a greater range of powers to the Family Court rather than transferring children to the Youth Court. We were told that this suggestion was outside of the scope of this bill.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Labour will speak strongly against the Government’s proposal to extend the Youth Court’s jurisdiction to 12- and 13-year-olds, and will introduce a Supplementary Order Paper to remove these provisions from the bill.</text>

          <heading>Young offenders</heading>
          <para>
            <text>New Zealand’s justice system currently moves young people (in most circumstances) into the adult system at the age of 17. As a result New Zealand is currently not meeting its obligations as a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. This issue was raised by a number of submitters, alongside evidence as to why young people up to the age of 18 should be treated as youth for the purposes of the criminal justice system. The Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Amendment Bill (No 6), which is currently on the Order Paper, sought to rectify this situation and these relevant provisions should have been picked up in this bill.</text>

          <heading>New sentencing options</heading>
          <para>
            <text>Labour supports in principle a greater range of sentencing options being made available to the Youth Court; however, we note that concerns were raised during the select committee process around the effectiveness of mentoring when compulsion is required, and the importance of mentors being well trained, supported, and available to young people beyond the length of the order. Labour will closely monitor the effectiveness of these orders.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Labour is also concerned that currently eighty percent of young people who appear before the Youth Court were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of their offending. While drug and alcohol orders may be beneficial, they are an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. The Government must ensure that enough emphasis is placed on early intervention through existing community-based drug and alcohol programmes—some of which have closed in recent months due to a lack of funding.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Labour is also disappointed that this bill has not been used to introduce a much needed, intensive, and tailored order for young sexual offenders. We also believe more should have been done to address the mental health issues that many young offenders present with.</text>

          <para>
            <text>Labour is disappointed that this bill was not used as a vehicle to introduce aspects of the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Amendment Bill (No 6). The CYFs No. 6 Bill was introduced by Labour in the last term, has been before select committee, and contained many procedural amendments that were non-controversial, including provisions to increase the role of victims in the youth justice system. Labour plans to introduce amendments to this effect as a Supplementary Order Paper during the final stages of this bill.</text>

          <heading>Military-style training</heading>
          <para>
            <text>Despite there being a number of substantive changes to the youth justice system contained in this bill, the most controversial element has been its association with military-style training camps, or <quote.in quote="1">boot camps</quote.in>.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Labour believes the Government has been disingenuous in the way it has presented its youth justice initiatives. Publicly the Government described <quote.in quote="1">Fresh Start</quote.in> as army-run boot camps. But in the face of intense opposition by those working in the sector, the Government tried to paint a quite different picture of these residential programmes.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Boot camps have been tried unsuccessfully both in New Zealand and abroad. The last occasion something similar was established in New Zealand 92 percent of participants reoffended at the completion of the programme. The majority of submitters pointed to this kind of evidence to challenge the Government’s proposals.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Labour notes that the pilot for these so-called military-run camps has already begun without the need for legislation, and little heed has been paid to the almost unanimous view of submitters. Many of these submitters were themselves already operating successful programmes for the same target group of offenders, but on a limited scale and with very little funding.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>If indeed these camps are different to those that have failed in the past, then we await the evidence to demonstrate that. In the meantime, an opportunity has been lost to inject support into existing programmes that have an evidence base to demonstrate they work, and would not have been a costly populist experiment.</text>

        <heading>Green Party minority view</heading>
        <para>
          <text>The Green Party does not accept the concept behind this bill that will treat children as adults for serious offending under the criminal law. In our view, the age of criminal responsibility must be no lower than 14 years. In addition the bill is contrary to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which cannot be justified. This Parliament should not pass any legislation that erodes the rights of children as this bill does.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Young children who commit serious offences must be managed in the context of their family and their age. All the available evidence shows that the younger the offender, the more likely the success of his or her rehabilitation if the intervention is family-based and immediate. The best opportunity for that kind of systemic family intervention is in the Family Court rather than the Youth Court. There is no justification for why children as young as this should be dealt with in more formal, criminal proceedings. Indeed the contrary is true, that by intervening with a family-based approach rather than a criminal law approach, the outcomes for the children, the family and society as a whole are greatly improved.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This bill deals with the issue of children and serious offending the wrong way around. The bill would only apply to a very limited number of children per year and provides no support for the family, additional resources to the Family or Youth Court, no commitment to ongoing work with the child to prevent both future offending and the circumstances that gave rise to the offending in the first place. This bill will increase the risk of recidivism by children who offend, and fail to create safer environments for those children or the community as a whole.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Finally, we reiterate the risk that this bill will disproportionately affect Māori children, creating even greater levels of disparity and facilitating prejudice in the community. Research shows that young Māori offenders are more likely to come to the attention of the police (and therefore the courts) even though the offending is less serious than their Pakeha counterparts. This bill will exacerbate these racist filters in the legal system, leading to a disproportionate impact on young Māori.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In order to create a safer community, the Government must invest in our families and at-risk families as early as possible through education and health services. Where offending by children occurs, immediate support must be wrapped around that family and that child to deal with the causes of that offending. This bill provides no solution to the risks that young children at risk of more serious offending face; indeed, it re-creates for children the failed policies that apply to adults and therefore makes our communities less safe for children overall.</text>
