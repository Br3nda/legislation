        <explnote.subhead1>Background</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Act provides for a youth justice system and establishes Youth Courts to deal with offending by 14- to 16-year-olds. The system is essentially diversionary in nature and unless the public interest requires otherwise, criminal proceedings should not be instituted against a young offender if there is an alternative means of dealing with the matter. This works well for most young offenders.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>However, the youth justice system offers limited sentencing options for those young offenders who are repeat offenders or who commit very serious offences. Sometimes the orders available are too short. In other cases, they do not give young offenders support of the kind that would enable them to make changes that would address the underlying causes of their offending. This Bill proposes changes to the sentencing options available to Youth Courts for this group of offenders, which is small in number but commits a disproportionate amount of youth crime. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill introduces a range of new sentencing orders, including orders to respond to the underlying causes of offending, and new options for dealing with repeat offenders or those who do not comply with the conditions of their community-based orders. This will assist the offenders and their families, and provide added protection for their communities.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The maximum lengths of the 2 most restrictive Youth Court orders (supervision with activity orders and supervision with residence orders) are doubled.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Child offending involving offences other than murder or manslaughter and that requires a formal response may be dealt with currently as a care and protection issue in a Family Court. This will continue to be the case. However, for a small group of the 12- and 13-year-olds who are charged with serious offences, the New Zealand Police will also have the option of commencing proceedings in a Youth Court. For these proceedings the Act will, subject to a few modifications, apply to these children as if they were young persons.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The Government is concerned about serious and recidivist offending by children and young people. It plans to give Youth Courts wider jurisdiction, to allow them to deal with 12- and 13-year-old offenders who commit serious offences, and introduce a range of new Youth Court sentencing options and programmes. These measures are expected to improve community safety and assist in addressing the underlying causes of offending by children and young people. </text>

        <para>
          <text>There are a number of serious and persistent offenders who cause significant harm to themselves, others, and their communities, and for whom the present system is not sufficiently effective. Based on the number of the higher-level orders used by Youth Courts and New Zealand Police apprehension figures, this group consists of about 1 000 serious young offenders aged between 12 and 16 years.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Persistent young offenders will irreparably damage their own futures and often blight the lives of the family and whānau, and the communities, around them. They will create more victims and incur increasing costs to society. They are destined to become the future supply of a growing adult prison population where capacity and the costs of increasing that capacity are already of concern.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>With certain exceptions,<footnote id="DLM1837928"><para><text>Prosecutions of children aged 10 or more and young persons for murder and manslaughter are heard in the High Court after a preliminary hearing in a Youth Court. Young persons charged with purely indictable offences or offences where jury trial is elected are tried in the High Court or a District Court after a preliminary hearing in a Youth Court, except where they are offered and accept Youth Court jurisdiction. Traffic offences not punishable by imprisonment are generally dealt with in District Courts.</text></para></footnote> offending is currently dealt with in Family Courts for children aged 10 to 13 years, and Youth Courts for young people aged 14 to 16 years. Both kinds of courts can take actions to hold children and young people accountable for their offending and to address the underlying causes of their offending. The actions Family Courts can take are based on addressing the care and protection issues that are affecting a child’s wellbeing. Youth Courts are criminal courts and, while they only convict young offenders for the most serious offences and discharge many young people, they can sentence young offenders to orders ranging from an admonishment, community work, and supervision and activity orders, to a custodial order (the supervision with residence order) of 3 months' duration.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Currently, children aged 10 to 13 years can only be prosecuted for murder or manslaughter. A small number of 12- and 13-year-olds commit serious offences such as attempted murder, aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, sexual violation (which includes rape), wounding with intent, and arson. There is also a small group of 12- and 13-year-olds who commit repeat offences, most notably burglary.</text>

        <para>
          <text>New Zealand Police apprehension figures indicate that currently about 80 12- and 13-year-olds a year commit these types of serious and repeat crimes.<footnote id="DLM1837929"><para><text>This figure is based on a count of apprehensions for offences punishable by 14 years' imprisonment or more and repeat offending for offences punishable by 10 years' imprisonment or more.</text></para></footnote> For this group of young offenders, further options should be available to the New Zealand Police and the Courts to address the offending.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A previous review of Youth Court sentences and options undertaken in 2006 found that the length of the current orders, particularly supervision with residence, does not provide a credible response to the behaviour of the most serious young offenders. The maximum term of 3 months is not sufficient to support appropriate programme interventions or to make significant behavioural changes that can be sustained post discharge.</text>

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Objectives</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The reforms aim to reduce re-offending by serious and recidivist child and youth offenders and thereby improve community safety. A related aim is to assist children and young people to get their lives on track and to lead socially constructive lives, free of crime.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Alternative options</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>Service and practice improvements were considered as alternatives to legislative change. There have been a number of service improvements in recent years. For example, a Child Offenders Manual has been developed to help practitioners understand the process for dealing with child offending, and health and education assessments have been introduced to inform family group conference planning in response to offending. New services have also been developed.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Service and practice improvements were not considered sufficient because the current legislation does not provide enough flexibility and options to adequately address the underlying causes of offending for this group of serious offenders.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In terms of the legislative proposals, options were explored in relation to the definition of serious offence to be used to determine whether a child’s offending could be dealt with in a Youth Court. Options included defining a serious offence in terms of offences punishable by a sentence of 5 years' imprisonment or more, or offences punishable by a sentence of 10 years' imprisonment or more. Based on evidence that young people diverted from formal youth justice processes are less likely to re-offend than those subject to those processes, these options were not considered appropriate.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Because of children’s reduced culpability and vulnerability due to their age, it was considered appropriate to set a high threshold (offences punishable by a sentence of 14 years' imprisonment or more, or serious repeat offending punishable by 10 years' imprisonment or more) in this area. This captures the very serious level of offences below murder and manslaughter and does not unduly increase costs or unnecessarily expose child offenders to the criminal justice process.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It was also considered whether children, like young people, should be able to be transferred to District Courts at sentencing so that a sentence of imprisonment could be considered. A transfer power was not seen as being necessary. This assessment was based on the wide range of current and proposed new orders that would be available in Youth Courts, and the need to protect children from imprisonment.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Preferred option</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to introduce legislation and to fund services to support the legislative changes. Evidence indicates that to stop re-offending by the most serious and repetitive group of young offenders, further legislative flexibility and options are necessary to address the causes underlying their offending. The Government’s proposals will provide a legislative framework that will enable interventions to be made that are based on evidence of what works to reduce re-offending by children and young people.</text>

          <text>These amendments have the benefit of giving Youth Courts a wide range of tools to address child and youth offending and access to new services designed to address the underlying causes of offending. This approach fits within the existing youth justice framework in that it focuses on holding children and young people accountable and acknowledging their development needs.</text>

          <text>International research shows that even small reductions in offending by serious and persistent young offenders have significant cost and social benefits.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The proposed changes will mainly impact on the Ministry of Social Development (Child, Youth and Family), which will be responsible for administering the new orders and contracting with non-government agencies for new services. They will also impact on the Ministry of Justice and New Zealand Police, where there will be a need to change information recording systems, and train the Judiciary and staff in the new legislation and administrative procedures. The introduction of a compulsory alcohol or alcohol rehabilitation programme order will have implications for the Ministry of Health. It is estimated that the changes associated with the Bill will cost approximately $35 million.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The main risk with the reforms, given that they are aimed at a difficult group to turn around, is that they will not reduce re-offending for this group. The causes of recidivism are complex. Careful attention is being paid to the design of interventions to ensure that young people receive the individualised support and services needed to address the underlying causes of their offending. There is also a risk that there will not be sufficient services to support some orders, such as alcohol or alcohol rehabilitation programme orders and longer custodial orders. These risks can be managed through new resourcing being sought in 2009 and the expansion of existing services.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>New Zealand has been criticised by the United Nations' Committee on the Rights of the Child for setting criminal responsibility at too low an age, and so including some 12- and 13-year-olds within Youth Courts' jurisdiction may attract further criticism. However, only a small number of children, those accused of committing the most serious offences and repeat serious offences (such as arson), will be affected, and they will still be dealt with in the youth jurisdiction in a way that is appropriate to their age. Youth Courts will be empowered to divert prosecutions of children that they consider the public interest requires should instead be dealt with under Family Courts' care and protection jurisdiction.</text>
