          <text>The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (<def-term id="DLM2381610">NZ ETS</def-term>) came into force on 26 September 2008. The key purpose of the NZ ETS is to enable New Zealand to comply with its international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (<def-term id="DLM2381611">UNFCCC</def-term>) (including for reducing and reporting on emissions levels) while providing certainty for economic growth, equity, and flexibility to respond to possible changes in the post-2012 international framework.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There is concern that the NZ ETS as currently designed may not meet these objectives, given the currently weak state of the economy and the recent developments in the Australian Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (<def-term id="DLM2381612">CPRS</def-term>). There is a need to ensure that there is a smooth transition for industry into the NZ ETS in order for it to adjust to the scheme while coping with the current economic recession. There is also a need to ensure that the levels of assistance (in the form of free allocation) are appropriate and key sectors of the economy do not experience undue competitive impacts as a result of the NZ ETS. Finally, there is a need to provide business with some certainty regarding the future of the NZ ETS and the levels of emissions reductions that New Zealand will be committed to meeting in the long term.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A number of problems have been identified with the NZ ETS, which the current government has committed to addressing. The issues fall into 2 categories—</text>

              <para>
                <text>Economic impacts – This includes concerns that the scheme could have large initial impacts on businesses given the current economic climate and that, in the longer term, it could result in the loss of key industries that are exposed to a carbon price ahead of international competitors. A key initiative since the development of the current NZ ETS is the Australian CPRS. The proposed CPRS will provide greater assistance to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed (<def-term id="DLM2381613">EITE</def-term>) industries than the NZ ETS. This could disadvantage New Zealand firms that compete in markets with Australian firms.</text>

                <text>Implementation time frames – There are some implementation dates in the Act which will be difficult to achieve as there is not enough time for allocation plans to be developed and for the sectors to prepare to enter the NZ ETS. The most pressing is the entry date of the Stationary Energy and Industrial Processes (<def-term id="DLM2381614">SEIP</def-term>) sectors which will begin to accrue obligations under the NZ ETS from 1 January 2010.</text>

          <text>A Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) was prepared for these proposals, and independently reviewed by Treasury’s Regulatory Impact Analysis Team (RIAT). RIAT has formed the view that the level and quality of analysis presented is not commensurate with the significance of the proposals, which represent major design changes to the Emissions Trading Scheme, and that the RIS does not provide an adequate basis for informed decision-making. Some key risks identified by RIAT include (but are not limited to) the following:</text>

          <text>As well as imposing an obligation on participants whose activities are covered by the scheme, the NZ ETS provides for <emphasis style="italic">allocation</emphasis> of units to certain participants.

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There are 2 main reasons for providing assistance to firms. One is to provide compensation where the introduction of a carbon price has reduced the value of assets. The other is to protect the competitiveness of firms, particularly those that are emissions-intensive and trade-exposed as these firms are unable to pass the carbon cost on to consumers. The appropriate method of allocation will depend on the reason for providing it.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Under the current NZ ETS, allocation has been provided in relation to pre-1990 forest land to compensate land owners for the loss in value of their land as a result of the costs imposed by the NZ ETS. A similar equity rationale applies in the case of allocation to the fishing sector. In respect of other sectors, the purpose of allocation is to avoid the loss of industries that would not have occurred if our competitors had adopted equivalent emissions pricing. The detail of how units are to be allocated to these persons will be set out in the relevant <emphasis style="italic">allocation plan</emphasis> for that sector. No allocation plans have yet been finalised.</text>

          <text>A number of problems have been identified with the NZ ETS, which the current government has committed to addressing, in a manner which is consistent with New Zealand’s international trade obligations, including under the World Trade Organisation.

        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Economic impacts</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>There are concerns that the NZ ETS as currently designed may cause large negative economic impacts on key sectors and the economy as a whole. These concerns are exacerbated by the current economic downturn and the introduction of the proposed CPRS which provides greater protection to key industries in Australia. There are 2 main areas of concern.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>
          <emphasis style="bold">Initial impacts of the NZETS on businesses given the current economic climate</emphasis>
        </explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>There is a need to provide smoother transition into the scheme while participants are dealing with the current recession and becoming familiar with their obligations and the operations of carbon markets. The concern is that while carbon markets are immature there could be potentially high and volatile carbon prices in early years of the scheme. It may be difficult for firms to manage their liabilities in such an uncertain environment.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>
          <emphasis style="bold">The loss of production from key industries</emphasis>
        </explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The concern about loss of production is greatest for firms that are both emissions-intensive (where production leads to significant levels of emissions) and trade-exposed (compete against goods produced in other countries that do not face similar emissions costs). The fear is that a loss of competitiveness from these EITE will result in carbon leakage, with market share being lost to countries that do not have emissions reduction policies in place. This will see a loss in production in New Zealand with no global environmental benefit.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There is justification for providing greater protection to avoid the loss of key industries that are expected to be competitive once international competitors adopt equivalent carbon pricing regimes and there is a concern that the phase-out of free allocation under the current scheme may cause key industries to lose competitiveness. Other countries (in particular Australia) are developing emissions trading schemes incorporating greater assistance for at-risk firms than is currently provided under the NZ ETS.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Harmonisation with the Australian Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>A key initiative since the development of the current NZ ETS is the Australian CPRS. The proposed CPRS will provide greater assistance to EITE firms than the NZ ETS. This could disadvantage New Zealand firms that compete in markets with Australian firms.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The New Zealand and Australian economies are closely linked, with many companies operating and trading across the Tasman. Further, Australia is New Zealand’s principal export market – 22.9% of New Zealand’s total exports were to Australia in the year to June 2008 – and New Zealand is Australia’s sixth largest export market – 5.6% of its total exports were to New Zealand in the year to June 2008. Australia and New Zealand also compete in third markets. Of the top 10 export markets for each country, New Zealand and Australia have 6 in common. Differences between the emission trading schemes of both countries, particularly levels of protection, could have a large impact on levels of trade between the 2 countries. </text>

        <para>
          <text>Together, these categories of export are worth around NZ$500 million and NZ$1.5 billion per annum to New Zealand and Australian exporters respectively. Seen only in terms of trans-Tasman trade, this represents a significant proportion – around 7% of trans-Tasman exports from New Zealand (possibly rising to 10% of New Zealand exports if it assumed that all ‘confidential exports’ are emissions-intensive) and around 15% of Australian exports.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>These figures describe areas of export risk for trans-Tasman trade. They also describe some of the key areas of import substitution risks if the importers concerned are being treated more favourably than domestic producers. However, this is not an exhaustive list – risks to exports and import substitution could change when a carbon price is introduced and could expand to other sectors.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The main source of competitiveness concerns relates to the allocation of permits under the New Zealand and Australian schemes. Stakeholders in both countries have raised this as an issue. The proposed CPRS currently allows for intensity-based allocation. Under this method, allocation is awarded on a unit of production basis for particular activities, based on the industry average emissions for that activity for the period from 2006 to 2008. The total pool of allocation to the industry sector is uncapped and both new and existing firms will be eligible for assistance. Initial levels of assistance are 94.5% of emissions for highly emissions-intensive activities, and 66% for moderately emissions-intensive activities. The free allocation is phased out at the rate of 1.3% per annum. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This method of allocation provides greater protection to levels of competitiveness because it minimises the marginal impacts of an emissions price. It provides an incentive for firms to improve efficiency, but does not provide an incentive to reduce levels of output against business as usual.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In contrast, the NZ ETS currently prescribes a cap on the total pool of free allocation to the industrial sector equivalent to 90% of 2005 emissions from eligible firms. The free allocation is phased out from 2018 to 2030 (a faster rate than under the CPRS). This method aims to avoid large reductions in output and unemployment but otherwise leaves firms facing the full cost of carbon including for new growth. This would invariably lead to some reduction in output.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Differences in allocation methodology between the 2 countries could also affect longer-term investment decisions and there is a risk that industries may shift production across the Tasman. It is difficult to quantify the potential extent of this occurring. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In summary, although competitiveness will depend on a variety of factors, all other things being equal, differences in allocation methodologies could cause certain activities to become more productive in one country over another, leading to one country loosing market share or production shifting across the Tasman.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Allocation under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS)</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Another competing economy with an emissions trading scheme is the European Union. Phase 3 of the EU ETS (2013 to 2020) will provide 2 levels of allocation – for those at significant risk of carbon leakage, and for other covered industries. Firms deemed at significant risk of leakage could receive up to 100% allocation based on 2005 to 2007 emissions. However, the free allocation to individual installations will not exceed the level of a benchmark corresponding to the 10% cleanest technologies in the EU. If an installation emits more than the benchmark level, it will need to acquire allowances up to the level of its actual emissions. The allocation to significantly at risk firms decreases by 1.74% per year. Not-at-risk sectors will receive 80% allocation based on 2005 to 2007 emission levels, decreasing to 30% in 2020 and zero in 2027.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Overall allocation in the scheme is made on an absolute basis, with an effective intensity-based allocation to individual participants within the pool via the top 10% benchmark. This approach would be difficult to implement in New Zealand as some industrial sectors have a small number of participants which could lead to difficulties in establishing a benchmark. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is difficult to quantify the level of allocation for EU firms deemed to be significantly at risk as this will depend on work yet to be completed on benchmarks and the distribution of emissions efficient technologies within industries. Therefore, it is also difficult to determine whether this approach is more or less generous than the Australian and New Zealand schemes. Nominally, it is more generous than the current NZ ETS allocation methodology, but whether this is the case in practice will depend on the stringency of the benchmarks. However, it is worth noting that at-risk sectors under the EU ETS will represent approximately 75% of total industry emissions covered by the EU ETS, which is a larger proportion than the emissions-intensive industries defined under the CPRS. </text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Implementation time frames</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The third problem with the current NZ ETS is that some implementation dates in the Act will be difficult to achieve as there is not enough time for allocation plans to be developed and for the sectors to prepare to enter the NZ ETS. The most pressing is the entry date of the SEIP sector, which will begin to accrue obligations under the NZ ETS from 1 January 2010.  There is not time to prepare an allocation plan for these sectors by 1 January 2010. If this date remains, there is likely to be a significant time lag between obligations beginning to accrue for these participants and an allocation plan being finalised (and units transferred).</text>

        <para>
          <text>Under the Kyoto Protocol New Zealand is obliged to return emissions to 1990 levels during the first commitment period (2008 to 2012), or take responsibility for the difference through international offsetting. Additionally, New Zealand is currently participating in negotiations for a future international climate change agreement, which is likely to involve deeper commitments for emissions reductions from 2013 onwards.</text>

          <text>These objectives address the need to ensure that there is a smooth transition for industry into the NZ ETS in order for them to adjust to the scheme and cope with the current economic recession. There is also need to ensure that the levels of assistance are appropriate and key sectors of the economy do not experience undue competitive impacts as a result of the NZ ETS. A further objective is to provide business with some certainty regarding the future of the NZ ETS and the levels of emissions reductions that New Zealand will be committed to meeting in the long term.  Finally, the scheme must also be workable and affordable.</text>

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Alternative options</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <explnote.subhead1>Option 1—Change implementation dates in existing legislation</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The first option is to leave the majority of the NZ ETS as it is currently legislated, and change the entry date for the Stationary Energy and Industrial Processes (SEIP) sectors.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The entry of the SEIP sectors would be delayed by 12 months from 1 January 2010 to 1 January 2011<footnote id="DLM2381619"><para><text>If the only change to the CCRA (2002) is to delay then the current allocation framework would have to be adhered to. A 12-month delay would therefore be necessary. If there is a change to the allocation framework in the Act, then a shorter time frame for the entry of this sector is possible.  </text></para></footnote>. This would incur a fiscal cost of roughly $175 million. The benefits are that the sector has more time to prepare to enter the NZ ETS, which could reduce the impacts to some extent. It also allows government sufficient time to prepare allocation plans.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This option, however, does not address all of the objectives listed above. It does not improve the competitiveness issues or provide assistance in early years of the scheme. Key differences would remain between the NZ ETS and the CPRS limiting harmonisation between the two schemes leaving the potential for increased transaction costs and competitiveness distortions.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Option 2—Abolish the NZ ETS</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The second option is to abolish the NZ ETS. Under this option, the New Zealand government would meet its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol by purchasing emissions credits from international markets. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The fiscal cost of abolishing the NZ ETS is estimated to be $1.5 billion in Commitment Period 1 of the Kyoto Protocol (2008–2012). The costs for future commitment periods would depend on the emissions reductions required under the 2020 target, but it can be assumed that they would be significantly higher than this.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This option is not preferred as it is not the long-term least-cost option for New Zealand to meet its international climate change commitments and it would not encourage any emissions reductions within New Zealand. The NZIER and Infometrics report (2009) found that in the short run (to 2012) there is little difference between the economy-wide welfare impacts of the government paying, and a narrow tax/trading scheme<footnote id="DLM2381620"><para><text>NZIER and Infometrics (2009) – Economic modelling of New Zealand climate change policy.</text></para></footnote>. However, the government pays option has a key disadvantage as it does not establish a price signal for carbon into the New Zealand economy. This means that firms have little incentive to change their production patterns or invest in emissions-reducing technologies. As the carbon price rises above a certain level<footnote id="DLM2381621"><para><text>The point at which a carbon price becomes preferable differed between the models. At $25/tonne Infometrics’ model ranks a carbon price equal to a government pays scenario while the NZIER model slightly favours the latter. At higher prices both models show that carbon pricing is least cost. </text></para></footnote>, the modelling showed that an emissions trading scheme becomes the cheaper option.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Climate change is a long-term problem and an international climate change framework of some description will exist long after 2012. In order to meet future international climate change commitments at least-cost to the economy, it is desirable to introduce a carbon price while the cost is still relatively low. This allows sectors time to adjust and smoothly transition to a low carbon economy. Delaying adjustment could be costly in the future as New Zealand would lock in investment choices that are inefficient in the long run when climate change agreements become more stringent and the world moves towards carbon pricing. Retaining the NZ ETS would also bring New Zealand in line with developments in other countries including the European Union, Australia, and the United States. </text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Option 3—Replace the NZ ETS with a carbon tax</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>An alternative price-based mechanism to an emissions trading scheme is a carbon tax. This is a very similar instrument to an emissions trading scheme, the fundamental difference being the mechanism by which the price is set. Under a carbon tax, regulators set the price per unit of emissions, whereas under an emissions trading scheme regulators set an allowable level of emissions or ‘permits’. A scarcity of these permits creates a price. A carbon tax therefore provides greater certainty over the price as changes to taxes are usually signalled well in advance, whereas an emissions trading scheme provides greater certainty over the level of emission reductions.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The other important difference is the ability to link the domestic policy response to climate change with the international response. The current global agreement is based around restricting quantities of emissions produced and an international emissions trading scheme. A domestic emissions trading scheme will allow linking with the international regime and other domestic emissions trading schemes. This provides New Zealand firms with access to the cheapest emissions reductions, regardless of where in the world they occur. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Arguments in support of a carbon tax are that greater certainty over price makes the liability easier for businesses to manage, and the administrative costs are likely to be lower than under an emissions trading scheme.</text>
        </para>

        <explnote.subhead1>Option 4—Delay the entry dates of all sectors other than forestry until 1 January 2013</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Under this option, all sectors would enter the NZ ETS on 1 January 2013, other than the forestry sector. The entry date for the forestry sector would remain at 1 January 2008.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This option would allow ample time for the preparation for sectors to enter the NZ ETS and solve the timing issues. It would also minimise the impacts of the scheme on trade-exposed sectors until 2013. In theory, the economic implications of this proposal are minor, provided there is no significant deforestation and there is an incentive for the post-1989 forestry sector to continue to invest in forestry projects.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>However, there is a risk of greater economic implications. A delay of sectoral entry until 2013 would signal uncertainty about the future existence and design of the NZ ETS, and a future carbon price may not be factored into investment decisions, which would delay the adjustment of the economy and increase the costs to New Zealand of complying with its international commitments in the long run.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This option would give rise to significant fiscal costs. The estimated fiscal cost of a delay to 2013 for the Stationary Energy and Industrial Processes (<emphasis style="bold">SEIP</emphasis>) and Liquid fossil Fuels (<emphasis style="bold">LFF</emphasis>) sectors is approximately $1.275 billion<footnote id="DLM2381622"><para><text>Assumes a carbon price of $25.</text></para></footnote>  relative to the status quo (ie, existing CCRA provisions).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The fiscal impact could be partially offset by removing the allocation of NZUs under the Forestry Allocation Plan.  It is estimated that the CP1 allocation, after allowing deductions for exemptions, will be approximately 16 million units<footnote id="DLM2381623"><para><text>This is based on approximate estimates of the deforestation that could occur on exempt areas.</text></para></footnote>. Cancelling this would result in savings of approximately $400 million. The total fiscal cost of this proposal is therefore approximately $875 million. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This would raise an equity issue for the pre-1990 forestry sector. This would be the only sector facing liabilities under the NZ ETS from 2008 to 2013. If the allocation of units were not provided the sector would not be given any compensation for the loss in the value of their assets.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>If sectoral entry dates are delayed, there will be no domestic demand for units generated from the post-1989 forestry sector. In order to ensure sufficient buyers for these units, the Government could consider setting up guaranteed purchasing arrangements for units generated from forestry. There would also be a strong case for permitting exports of units from the post-1989 forestry sector.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>From an international perspective, delaying the entry of sectors until 2013 will be seen as a weakening of New Zealand’s commitment to address climate change. This is likely to have some effect on New Zealand’s bargaining position in the negotiations for future international agreements.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>If sector entry dates are to be delayed, the current reporting schedules in the Act could still be retained. Mandatory reporting is currently due to commence for the SEIP and LFF sectors on 1 January 2010. For the agriculture sector, voluntary reporting is due to commence on 1 January 2011, followed by mandatory reporting in 2012. Retaining these reporting schedules would assist sectors with managing their emissions and preparing for entry to the NZ ETS in 2013.</text>

          <text>Together, these 2 changes would ensure that the effective price of carbon facing participants in these sectors would never exceed $12.50 per tonne before 1 January 2013, and could be lower if the international carbon price fell below NZ$25 over that period.  </text>

          <text>These changes will substantially lessen the impact of the NZ ETS on participants in these 2 sectors until the end of 2012, providing a far smoother transition for industry and the economy as a whole.  In turn this will help to ensure that households do not face large price increases. The changes will therefore provide a significant improvement for the important first years of the scheme’s operation, when participants are becoming familiar with their obligations and the operation of carbon markets. Although there could potentially be a big jump in the carbon price at the end of the transition phase, this should not have a large impact on the sector as they will have time to prepare and will be able to monitor movements in the carbon price during the transition period. </text>

                <text>the phase out of free allocation will also be considered through a 5-yearly review, with the first review conducted in 2011. Any significant changes to the provision of free allocation will require a 5 year notice period.</text>

          <text>This adoption of an intensity-based approach to allocation will provide ongoing protection for the subset of New Zealand firms that would otherwise be most at risk of suffering a substantial loss of competitiveness under the NZ ETS. This is because intensity-based allocation will reduce the marginal cost impacts of an emissions price. An increase in output of a firm will lead to both an increase in the liability to surrender emissions units, and the number of emissions units issued. The marginal cost and competitive effects are therefore reduced by the free allocation. Additionally, free allocation can be provided to both existing firms and new entrants. As this form of assistance takes into account expansion of production of emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries, it supports growth in these industries and reduces the likelihood of carbon leakage.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>An intensity-based approach to allocation will therefore help to avoid undue disruption to the economy, and maintain the ability of businesses in sectors where New Zealand currently has a clear competitive advantage to continue to grow.  This change would provide savings over the early years of the scheme’s operation, but impose increasingly large fiscal costs over the long term.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The allocation methodology and thresholds would be based as much as is sensible on the Australian CPRS model. The CPRS approach is based on extensive analysis, and drawing from the CPRS approach will assist in implementing intensity-based allocation within the limited time available.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The CPRS model uses allocative baselines based on the historical industry average of emissions per unit of output. This method provides an incentive for firms to be more efficient than the industry average while still maintaining competitiveness with international firms.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This change is likely to reduce the level of abatement from the scheme particularly beyond 2018 (when the current allocation is due to start phasing out). New Zealand will still meet its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, but the government may have to purchase a greater amount of emissions units from overseas in order to do so. Again, this is discussed further in the section on wider economic impacts.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Implementing the Australian allocation methodology would bring about benefits from reduced transaction costs for businesses operating across the Tasman and reduced trans-Tasman competitiveness distortions, particularly for emissions-intensive companies.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Given the increased benefits that industry will receive under intensity-based allocation, the current Innovation Fund will be removed from the Act as it is no longer necessary. In addition, the provision for the Household fund under section 223 of the Act will be removed. </text>

        <para>
          <text>These changes are expected to have only minimal impacts on the sector and the wider economy.  The $25 fixed price option is in line with the expected international price, so the sector faces the same incentive to reduce emissions as under the current scheme. It will provide a modest benefit to forest owners wishing to deforest during Commitment Period 1 (<def-term id="DLM2381624">CP1</def-term>), through greater price certainty.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The forestry sector will be permitted to bank and export units during the transition phase. The arbitrage risks associated with this are low, and restrictions on banking and exports would reduce the economic incentives for this sector adding costs to the economy as a whole. Allowing banking is desirable to assist with managing the long-term nature of forestry investments. However, it may be necessary to ban exports from the forestry sector in the future in the event that the NZ ETS and the CPRS are linked. In this case, foresters would be able to sell units to the Australasian market.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>To reduce litigation risk and to retain flexibility over the second tranche of allocation, it is necessary to amend the draft allocation plan. It is further recommended to amend the Act to include as much detail as possible on forestry allocation, specifically to make explicit that only 21 million units will be transferred during CP1 and the approach to distributing units. </text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Agriculture sector</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>As agriculture makes up nearly 50% of New Zealand’s emissions, it is important that it is covered by the NZ ETS. However, the impact of the NZ ETS as currently legislated on the agriculture sector could be significant, given that the sector has limited abatement options available to them.  Therefore there is a strong case for facilitating a gentler transition for agriculture into the ETS than is currently proposed. There is also a case for ensuring we can reflect on Australian decisions expected in 2013 about possible inclusion of agriculture in the CPRS from 2015, before agriculture enters the NZ ETS.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The entry date for the agriculture sector will therefore be changed to 1 January 2015. The delayed start will substantially lessen the impact of the NZ ETS on the agriculture sector until the end of 2015, providing far smoother transition for the sector and the economy as a whole.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A further amendment to the agriculture sector is to shift to an intensity-based approach to allocation. The approach to phase-out will be consistent with industry. In line with the industry allocation provisions, there would be a review of allocation policies every 5 years.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The adoption of an intensity-based approach will protect the competitiveness of this industry until more effective emission abatement technologies have been developed, or until there is more effective global action on agricultural emissions, including by developing countries, than is the case with the current international framework. </text>

        <para>
          <text>Allocation to agriculture should be based on the current year’s output, rather than historic output levels.

        <explnote.subhead1>Fishing sector</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>As fishing is an emissions-intensive trade-exposed sector, the allocation will be increased from the current level of 50%, to 90% of 2005 emissions for two and a half years (July 2010 to December 2012). The transition phase (ie, 50% progressive obligation) will also apply to this sector and the number of units allocated to this sector will be reduced by 50% during the transition phase. The fiscal and economic impacts of this change are likely to be small.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is proposed that legislation will specify a total number of units for free allocation to the fishing sector and that this number will be equivalent to 90% of 2005 emissions for two and a half years (ie, to match the reduced price period), adjusted for a 2:1 progressive obligation being in place. It is further proposed that the number placed in legislation be based on a Ministry of Fisheries fuel consumption estimate for 2005 of 216 million litres. This is believed to be the best estimate available. This amount of fuel would result in 700 000 emissions units being granted to the sector.</text>

          <text>Key criteria in the development of the <emphasis style="italic">50 by 50</emphasis> target were that it needs to be internationally credible, suitable to New Zealand’s unique economic profile and time-bound. A <emphasis style="italic">50 by 50</emphasis> target is not inconsistent with the IPCC’s 450 parts per million climate stabilisation scenario and New Zealand’s international negotiating position proposes supports a global long-term concentration target of not more than 450ppm. It is also broadly equivalent to the Australian long-term target of a 60% reduction by 2050 compared to 2000 emission levels.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is proposed that a regulation making power for setting targets be introduced. The regulation making power would also require the target to be reviewed following the release of future Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Reports. The regulation making power would have the same legal effect as a target under the existing gazette mechanism but has the benefit of having a perceived higher status than a target set under the existing mechanism. Furthermore, a regulation making power would provide flexibility to amend the target in response to future IPCC assessment reports.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The modified NZ ETS will cover all sectors and all gases within a reasonable time frame. It will therefore achieve its original objective of reducing emissions and allowing New Zealand to comply with its international obligations in a manner that is least-cost to the economy, equitable and flexible. It sends a clear signal that the economy will face a carbon price into the future, providing businesses with certainty to plan investment decisions. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The transition phase under the modified NZ ETS will smooth the transition for participants in early years of the scheme and minimise the chance of high or volatile carbon prices. This will give firms time to adjust to their obligations under the NZ ETS while minimising the impact of the scheme during this period. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In addition, moving to an intensity-based allocation model will minimise the impacts of competitiveness on New Zealand firms and industries that are exposed to international competitors who do not face equivalent carbon charges. Intensity-based allocation provides an incentive for firms to improve efficiency, but does not provide an incentive to reduce levels of output, and can be better targeted at those sectors whose international competitiveness is most at risk from the introduction of a price on carbon. Recent economic analysis<footnote id="DLM2381628"><para><text>NZIER and Infometrics (2009) Economic Modelling of New Zealand Climate Change Policy. </text></para></footnote>  has shown that intensity-based allocation will assist with lowering the costs of the NZ ETS and protecting EITE industries. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>These 2 changes will assist with achieving the objectives of striking a balance between New Zealand’s environmental and economic interests, and providing a smoother transition and greater certainty for economic growth into the future.</text>

          <emphasis style="roman">Transition phase</emphasis>
        </explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The transition phase will operate for a relatively short period of time, and there is expected to be minimal change in total costs to the economy between this option and the status quo. The difference will be where the costs fall within the economy.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The transition phase will result in lower cost to industry than the NZ ETS as currently legislated for this period if the international carbon price is above $12.50 per tonne (which is expected to be the case). Firms in the SEIP sector are expected to benefit the most. The duration of the transition phase is too short to affect investment decisions, and as firms will be aware that they will face a higher carbon price in the future there will still be an incentive to invest in low emissions and energy efficient technologies. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The transition phase will result in a smaller increase in fuel costs than the current NZ ETS, lowering the cost to households. Petrol is expected to rise by about 3c/litre (1.8%) which is less than the 6.1c/ litre (4%) that is estimated to result from a carbon price of $25 per tonne, and the increase in electricity prices is estimated to be 0.8c/KWh (3.6%) compared to 1.4c/KWh (6.3%) from a carbon price of $25. These figures assume that the carbon costs are fully passed through. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>However, while the transition will reduce costs to industry the government will have to meet any difference between the fixed price option and the international carbon price in order to meet New Zealand’s liability under the Kyoto Protocol.  </text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Forestry</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>One sector that could experience significant impacts is the forestry sector. This sector can adjust quickly to changes in the carbon price, so there is the potential that a short-term reduction in price could drive short-term deforestation as foresters seek to convert land while the prices are relatively low. This would cause a short-term increase in emissions. The forestry sector has therefore been excluded from the reduced obligation but will be able to access the $25 fixed price option, which approximates the expected international carbon price over this period providing the same incentive to reduce emissions as the current NZ ETS. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Unlike the SEIP sector, the pre-1990 forest sector will also receive a full allocation of units during the transition phase as the free allocation represents compensation for the long-term reduction in land values faced by the sector. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The ownership of post-1989 forests is currently the only <emphasis style="italic">net removal activity</emphasis> allowed under the NZ ETS. In contrast to the rest of the economy, owners of these forests benefit from a higher price on carbon. Reduction of expected returns to forestry or high levels of uncertainty among investors could reduce investment in new planning and participation of existing post-1989 foresters in the ETS – both outcomes come at a high economic cost. It is difficult to quantify this impact. However, it should be noted that even relatively small changes to the new planting rate can create a significant economic impact. If the new planting rate under the modified scheme is 10,000 ha per year lower than the new planting rate under a scheme that allows exports, an economic benefit to New Zealand (potentially in the order of $125-$200 million<footnote id="DLM2381629"><para><text>This is based on findings from both Scion (2008) and University of Canterbury that the expected value of forestry land with a $30 international price on carbon would increase by $5,000-$8,000. To estimate the economic cost of a decrease planting these values are multiplied by the number of new hectares planted over CP1 (25,000 ha). </text></para></footnote>) would be delayed. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In order to provide some certainty for investment decisions, the banking and exporting of emission units will be permitted for both the pre-1990 and post-1989 forestry sectors during the transition phase. The risk of arbitrage from allowing exports during the transition phase is considered to be low as the level of deforestation for pre-1990 forests is not expected to be significant. Allowing exports for post-1989 foresters will ensure that the sector receives the full economic incentive for new investment. </text>

          <emphasis style="roman">Intensity-based allocation</emphasis>
        </explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Intensity-based allocation for industry is likely to give rise to a fiscal saving from 2010 to 2012 of $177 million, as initially a smaller proportion of firms will receive assistance. It is also estimated that there will be savings of $181–$351 million in 2013 and $49 to $221 million in 2020. By 2030 there will be a fiscal cost of approximately $411–586 million. The fiscal cost arises from the government taking responsibility for a proportion of emissions from the firms that receive free allocation and the cost will depend on the chosen rates of assistance.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>An intensity-based allocation approach will provide greater protection to the competitiveness of the industries that receive assistance and will lower the cost of the emissions trading scheme on these participants. Protecting the competitiveness of more firms by providing a higher rate of assistance for a longer period will benefit eligible firms, but will come at a cost to the economy as a whole, by delaying the transition of the New Zealand economy to a carbon constrained world. The consistency with New Zealand’s international trade obligations would also need to be taken into account. The review mechanism will allow for future changes to free allocation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The costs and benefits of intensity-based allocation on the wider economy are somewhat ambiguous. Economic theory suggests that placing responsibility for emissions with those who reduce them is the least-cost way to meet emissions targets; however, this ignores adjustment costs, economic regrets when other countries may introduce emissions pricing in the future and some general equilibrium effects, particularly around reduction in exports. Recent economic modelling by NZIER and Infometrics suggests that these factors may be significant, and that it may be beneficial to freely allocate units to emissions-intensive trade-exposed firms. NZIER and Infometrics also found that free allocation based on a lump sum payment to compensate firms for stranded assets is more costly than production-linked free allocation. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Infometrics/NZIER report (2009) concluded that competiveness at risk issues need to be considered. Free allocation, linked to production can be a cost-reducing mechanism of dealing with high costs of abatement and lack of action by other countries. The report also found that free allocation for stranded assets (provided as a lump sum payment) is more costly than production-linked free allocation. As technology options become available and the rest of the world takes steps to implement equivalent pricing regimes, the benefit of free allocation becomes reduced. Although the phase out of free allocation under this option is gradual, it will be subject to a 5-yearly review and can be changed if New Zealand’s economic circumstances are such that this level of assistance is no longer beneficial. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Under an intensity model, highly emissions-intensive firms will receive more assistance than under the previous allocation approach. However, some firms that would have received assistance under the previous approach will fall below the emissions-intensity thresholds and will be ineligible to receive assistance under the new approach. The firms that do not receive allocation will however still benefit from the transition phase in the first two and a half years after SEIP and LFF enter the scheme.</text>

        <para>
          <text>As it is proposed that the target be set through regulation, with a review mechanism, it is unlikely that the economic consequences will be significant. The economic implications of setting the <emphasis style="italic">50 by 50</emphasis> target in the purpose provisions of the CCRA are likely to depend on New Zealand’s obligations under any future international climate change agreement. If New Zealand’s international emission reduction obligations are less stringent than 50% by 2050 then the target could impose costs on the economy. To prevent this, the Government could adjust the target to reflect New Zealand’s international commitment.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is difficult to estimate the economic impacts of such a target due to the long time frame involved, and no economic modelling of the costs and benefits of a <emphasis style="italic">50 by 50</emphasis> target has been completed for New Zealand. However, studies completed internationally, including work by the Garnaut Climate Change Review and the Australian Treasury suggest that economies continue to grow when taking on large emissions reductions targets, albeit at a slower rate. For example the Australian Treasury found that with an emissions reduction target of 60% below 2000 levels by 2050, average annual economic growth is reduced from 1.3% to 1.1% for Australia. This model assumed staged international participation of carbon pricing by the rest of the world. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The costs to New Zealand of such a target will be influenced by the actions of the rest of the world and will be lower if other countries take on similar targets. However, economic modelling still indicates that the economy will continue to grow even when international participation is limited. Although the recent modelling by NZIER and Infometrics only modelled scenarios out to 2020, the results showed that the New Zealand economy continued to grow under all scenarios, even under a $100 carbon price and no action by the rest of the world. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The 2006 Stern Review found that if the world does not act to address climate change, the overall risk could be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global GDP per annum now and forever. If a wider range of risks are taken into account, this could rise to 20% or more. Similarly the Garnuat Climate Change Review conducted in 2008 also found that the costs of inaction were greater than the costs of action. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Although New Zealand is only responsible for a small proportion of global emissions, there is a risk that New Zealand could suffer significant environmental effects as a result of climate change. Additionally, if the global economy is affected this will have flow-on effects to the New Zealand economy. The only way to address these environmental and economic risks is through a global agreement and New Zealand’s ability to influence global agreements relies on its active participation in negotiations, and its reputation as a country that is willing to do its fair share and meet its international obligations. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In addition, there are international and trade risks if New Zealand is not perceived to be doing its fair share to address climate change. New Zealand is a small, open economy that relies on international agreements and treaties to support its trade. There is also a risk that trade barriers could be established against countries that have not taken on emissions reduction commitments. </text>

        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Fiscal cost to the Crown being higher than anticipated</emphasis>. Both the transition phase and the intensity-based allocation shift some of the costs of New Zealand’s international liability from emitters to the crown, and subsequently increase the risk to the Crown. This is a particular risk for intensity-based allocation. If the cost is on emitters, emitters have the choice as to whether to purchase permits to cover their emissions, reduce output or invest in mitigation options. The Crown has fewer options for managing emissions, and will be liable for any emissions that exceed the level of emissions specified in Kyoto and successive agreements. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The transition phase will operate for a relatively short period of time so the risk is not large. Intensity-based allocation is a long term provision that could potentially expose the crown to large risks. However, the 5 year review will provide a mechanism for the policy to be changed if the cost is becoming excessive.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Arbitrage arising from the fixed price option</emphasis>. If units issued through the fixed price option fall below the international price the units could be sold at a profit at the Crown’s expense. The level of arbitrage risk will depend on the difference between the fixed price option and the expected international price. In order to mitigate this risk, the export of units will be banned from all sectors who can access the fixed price option, other than forestry. This will not reduce the risk of arbitrage completely (since banking is still possible), but might reduce the level of administrative complexity. It is desirable to allow banking for SEIP and LFF sectors, as a ban on banking would reduce the size of the market for these participants and may lead to opportunities for market manipulation. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Compressed timetable</emphasis>. Although delaying the entry date for the SEIP sector by 6 months will allow more time to develop an allocation plan, and there is a greater chance of achieving this time frame than the time frame under the current Act. However, there is still a risk that the allocation process would not be complete by the entry date of 1 July 2010. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The most likely option for mitigating this risk is to draw on work completed under the Australian CPRS. The Australians have made significant progress towards producing activity definitions and allocative baselines and are expected to complete the majority of this work by the end of 2009. Drawing on Australian work as much as possible is likely to allow the timetable to be met.</text>

In effect, those emitting greenhouse gases have to pay for increases in emissions and are rewarded for decreases. This encourages emissions reductions.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The NZ ETS covers emissions of the following 6 greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO<subscript>2</subscript>), methane (CH<subscript>4</subscript>), nitrous oxide (N<subscript>2</subscript>O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF<subscript>6</subscript>). These are the greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol<footnote id="DLM2381631"><para><text>Under the Kyoto Protocol New Zealand is obliged to take responsibility for all emissions above 1990 levels for the first commitment period (2008-2012)</text></para></footnote>.</text>

        <para>
          <text>In respect of each sector covered by the NZ ETS, there are a number of ‘participants’. Each participant must calculate the emissions from their activities and surrender to the government 1 emission unit for each tonne of greenhouse gas emissions (measured as CO<subscript>2</subscript>e) for which they are responsible. There are various types of units that participants can use to meet their obligations under the emissions trading scheme. </text>

          <text>The primary unit of trade for the New Zealand emissions trading scheme is the New Zealand Unit (NZU). The NZU is a unit issued and allocated by the government under the scheme. One NZU corresponds to 1 tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. </text>

        <para>
          <text>In addition, participants can use most types of Kyoto emission units for compliance. As with NZUs, this is done by transferring the Kyoto emission units to a surrender account. Kyoto emission units are units established under the rules of the Kyoto Protocol. </text>

        <para>
          <text>The Climate Change Response Act identifies who is required to be a participant under the NZ ETS.

        <para>
          <text>Section 71 of the Act sets out the issues that must or may be set out in the Forestry Allocation Plan. One of the issues that may be covered in the Draft Allocation Plan is a date or event on which the land is to be treated as transferred.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The proposal set out in the Draft Allocation Plan confirms the Act’s default that the land is to be treated as transferred on the <quote.in quote="1">settlement date</quote.in>, which in a sale and purchase situation would have been agreed by the seller and purchaser. This is effectively the date when the new owner would have taken control of the land and paid any outstanding monies.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The transfer date is important because it affects the amount of allocation that pre-1990 land receives. The rationale behind the decreased allocation for land that was transferred after 31 October 2002 was that once the previous government first announced its intention to introduce policies to control rates of deforestation, a willing buyer could have factored that into the purchase price they were willing to pay for the land. However, this rationale does not apply to land that was transferred after 31 October 2002 by operation of law, for example by order of the court, or by transmission on the death of a joint owner.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The drafting of section 71 may inadvertently catch such situations and could result in such a new owner receiving a reduced allocation. Recent legal advice casts doubt over whether the wording of section 71 unambiguously gives the Minister the power to clarify the meaning of <quote.in quote="1">transfer</quote.in> via the Allocation Plan to ensure that the above policy intent is met, and that land that has been transferred by operation of law is not automatically ineligible for a higher allocation of units. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In order to remove the risk of legal challenge on this point, it would be desirable to amend section 71 to clarify that the Forestry Allocation Plan whether issued before or after this amendment may define what is meant by the concept of ‘transfer’ for the purposes of allocation.</text>

        </explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>MAF is developing methodology to measure emissions and removals for forest land, rather than relying on generalised lookup tables. This methodology will be reflected in the forestry sector regulations. One of the features of this measurement approach is the requirement that an applicant’s forest land-holding be divided, and information collected at locations within each divided area, in a manner to be further prescribed in regulations and/or standards. Information collected at the specified locations will be used to calculate forest emissions and removals.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Act does not currently provide the chief executive with a clear authority to specify either how an applicant’s land-holding should be divided, or the locations in the forest where prescribed information should be collected. The division of forest land area and the location of the information collected will have a significant impact on the carbon measurement accuracy. This power is therefore crucial to ensuring that the areas and locations within which the information is collected are not the subject of debate or challenge by participants, nor to arbitrary relocation, say to a less representative forest area. This issue can be addressed by making a small amendment to the regulation making power, to make it clear that the chief executive can specify the areas and locations from which data must be collected.</text>

However, section 205 of the Act expressly provides that the activity of mining natural gas that occurs in the EEZ is mining activity for the purposes of the Act. There is an argument that a person mining gas in the EEZ falls under both the activity of mining and is also technically importing gas which would require that person to register as an importer of gas and comply with the provisions of the Act.</text>

        </explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The NZ ETS contains provisions to allow deforestation of <quote.in quote="1">tree weeds</quote.in> (eg, wilding pines) to apply for and receive an exemption from the deforestation provisions of the Act (becoming a mandatory participant, filing an emissions return and surrendering emissions units). These exemption provisions were inserted so that efforts to eradicate tree weeds would not be discouraged by the NZ ETS.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>As currently drafted, the Act restricts the availability of exemptions to land that was forested at the time the exemption is granted. Exemptions therefore cannot be granted to landowners who have already deforested since 1 January 2008 (this amounts to an estimated 800 ha to date). This situation means that land owners may be penalised for carrying out weed eradication activities because, due to timing issues, the tree weed exemption is not available to them. This is particularly concerning because landowners are often required to deforest weed trees by regional councils as part of the regional pest management strategy to manage the spread of the trees. Further, it affects the ability of government departments like DOC and LINZ to pursue their mandates of removing tree weeds under other legislation and government policy.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The existing situation is unfair to those landowners who have continued their efforts to eradicate tree weeds and now face a liability. It also risks worsening the spread of tree weeds where control programmes have ceased.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Accordingly, it is proposed that the Act be amended to allow tree weed forest land that has been deforested since 1 January 2008 to be eligible for an exemption (once an exemption process is available). This does not result in an increased level of deforestation or increased fiscal costs over and above what was estimated to be incurred by the tree weed exemption overall – as the area of pre-1990 tree weed forest is finite.</text>

However, the Act does not currently provide for fees to be charged in respect of persons who are mandatory participants in the NZ ETS. This presents a problem because mandatory participants are able to make binding ruling applications. These applications are likely to be complex and will require significant time to process. It is also likely that external legal advice (from the Crown Law Office) and expert technical advice may be required in respect of some or all applications. Accordingly, it is strongly recommended that the Act be amended to allow for cost recovery in respect of applications for binding rulings by mandatory participants.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is proposed to amend the Act to address these concerns.  There remain strong policy reasons for retaining the joint participant requirements in respect of other activities. However, these policy reasons do not apply to the same extent to persons mining natural gas through the vehicle of an unincorporated joint venture.  Notably, the number of participants is likely to be manageable and there will be ways to ensure that all emissions are accounted for.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is therefore recommended that the Act be amended to provide that where more than 1 person is named on a permit relating to mining natural gas, each of the permit holders is to be treated as the person carrying out the activity of mining natural gas and must comply with the obligations of a participant under the Act.  Following this amendment, joint venture participants would no longer be required to be joint participants under the NZ ETS, although related companies appearing on the same permit would still have the option to do so.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>If the Act is amended as proposed (to provide for individual permit holders to be the participant under the NZ ETS) a number of consequential changes will also be required.  These consequential amendments include providing sufficient flexibility regarding joint reporting for related companies carrying out the activity of mining natural gas, as well as ensuring that opt-in provisions work effectively where gas is purchased from a member of the group which is not in fact the participant, such as a parent company of the company carrying out the mining activity.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The coal sector has not made representations on these issues.  However, officials have advised that it would be appropriate to extend the proposed amendments to include the coal sector.  The problems identified by the natural gas sector are likely to be applicable, at least to some extent, to participants in the coal sector – although the problems are likely to be less widespread because joint ventures are a much less common arrangement in the coal sector.  As in the natural gas sector, the proposed amendments would not result in a large increase in participant numbers (at present, the increase in participant numbers in the coal sector would be negligible) and there will be ways to ensure that all emissions are accounted for.</text>

          <text>As presently drafted, the Act is not entirely clear regarding the scope of the rulings that can be obtained.

          <text>The proposed amendments to the NZ ETS will increase certainty for participants and administrators and enable more effective implementation of the NZ ETS.  This will enhance the credibility of the NZ ETS which will have benefits to the wider economy.  No negative implications for the wider economy have been identified. </text>

          <text>A Bill making substantive amendments to the NZ ETS is expected to be introduced into the House in late September, and is due to be passed in December 2009. The amendments proposed in this statement will be included as part of that Bill. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It will be important to inform the relevant sectors regarding clarification of inclusions and exclusions from the NZ ETS.  Plans are in place to contact relevant parties once policy is clarified.  As regards administrative processes, changes and clarifications will be communicated as part of the ongoing process of implementing the NZ ETS.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Agencies responsible for administering the NZ ETS will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the administrative provisions in the governing legislation and make further recommendations for amendment if required.  The effectiveness of administrative provisions may also be reviewed in the context of the scheduled reviews of the operation and effectiveness of the NZ ETS, as required by section 160 of the Act. The first review is to be completed by the end of 2011.</text>

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Consultation</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The Ministry for Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Economic Development have important roles in implementing the NZ ETS and a large number of the proposed amendments to the governing legislation are recommended changes initiated by these agencies. The Ministry for the Environment has worked with these agencies to develop the proposed amendments, which are agreed on by all agencies involved. The following further government departments have been consulted on the proposals and have not raised any concerns: the Treasury, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Ministry of Transport, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Te Puni Kōkiri. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The proposed amendments are largely administrative in nature.  Accordingly, there has been no formal stakeholder consultation.  However, some of the proposed clarificatory amendments result from questions raised by stakeholders in the course of consultation on specific aspects of the NZ ETS. In particular, a number of amendments arise from consultation with the stationary energy and industrial processes sector on draft regulations relating to that sector (for example, the amendment to remove the activity of producing cable using a nitrogen cure process and the amendment to clarify the treatment of emissions from the combustion of biofuels).</text>
