        <heading>Recommendation</heading>
        <para>
          <text>The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee has examined the Cluster Munitions (Prohibition) Bill and recommends that it be passed with the amendments shown.</text>

        <heading>Introduction</heading>
        <para>
          <text>The purpose of the bill is to enable New Zealand to meet its obligations under the Cluster Munitions Convention (the Convention) by prohibiting the use of cluster munitions, and activities including the acquisition, possession, retention, stockpiling, and transfer of cluster munitions. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Our commentary on the bill addresses only the more significant amendments we recommend. It does not cover minor or technical amendments.</text>

        <heading>Title of the bill</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend amending the title of the bill by deleting the brackets around the word “Prohibition”. We consider that without the brackets the title would convey the purpose and the contents of the bill more clearly. </text>

        <heading>Definition of explosive bomblet and explosive submunition</heading>
        <para>
          <text>Clause 5(1) provides definitions of “explosive bomblet” and “explosive submunition”. We consider these definitions to be substantively different from their respective meanings as set out in the Convention. We recommend amending the definitions of “explosive bomblet” and “explosive submunition” to render them consistent with their counterparts in the Convention.  </text>
        </para>
      </comm.lev1>
      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Definition of cluster munition</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend replacing clause 6 to make it clear that the definition of cluster munition includes explosive submunitions. Article 2(2) of the Convention explicitly includes explosive submunitions, recognising that they are the dangerous component of a munition—not the shell that encases them. Our recommended amendment would make the bill’s definition of cluster munition consistent with that set out in the Convention. </text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Application of the Act to certain explosive bomblets</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We consider that clause 10 might have unintended consequences, as it applies all provisions of the bill to certain explosive bomblets. We recommend deleting clause 10 and inserting new clause 12A to make it clear that the offences and exceptions provisions in subpart 1 apply to the explosive bomblets in question. This would then reflect the approach in Article 1(2) of the Convention.</text>
        </para>
      </comm.lev1>
      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Application of the Act overseas</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend amending clause 9 to insert new subclause (2)(d) to provide for the application of the Act overseas to a body corporate, or a corporation sole, incorporated in New Zealand. This would ensure that New Zealand companies did not engage in activities overseas that would be an offence if undertaken in New Zealand. We also recommend inserting subclause 3 to make it clear that section 7, 8, or 8A of the Crimes Act 1961 would apply so that, in the circumstances set out in those sections, the offences specified in the bill that occurred overseas would be regarded as occurring in New Zealand for the purposes of prosecutions.</text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Application of the Act to cluster munition clearing activities</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We are aware of concern that the application of the bill would inadvertently criminalise New Zealanders who worked for humanitarian or commercial organisations that legitimately clear sites of cluster munitions overseas. We understand that it is not the intent of the bill to criminalise such people, as they work to clear or destroy cluster munitions.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend amending clause 12 by inserting new subclause 4(A), which would provide that a person does not commit an offence when they undertake cluster munition clearance activities overseas in a way that accords with the Convention.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We also recommend amending clause 17 to insert new subclause 5, to exclude a person who is working overseas clearing cluster munitions from being required to supply information to the Minister in relation to that conduct.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Our recommendations would ensure that people working for organisations that clear cluster munitions were not inadvertently criminalised for humanitarian action.</text>
        </para>
      </comm.lev1>
      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Attorney-General’s consent to prosecute</heading>
        <para>
          <text>The bill as drafted does not include a procedural protection that is often found in statutes that give New Zealand courts extraterritorial jurisdiction. Such provisions make prosecution conditional on the Attorney-General’s consent.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend inserting new clause 17A to require the Attorney-General’s consent to prosecute the offences provided for in clause 11. However, a person who is alleged to have committed an offence could be arrested or a warrant for the person’s arrest issued and executed, and the person remanded in custody or on bail without the consent of the Attorney-General.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We also recommend that section 400 of the Crimes Act 1961, which requires the Attorney-General’s consent to some prosecutions, should not apply in respect of any offence specified in the bill, because the bill provides in new clause 17A for its own regime regarding the Attorney-General’s consent to prosecutions.</text>
        </para>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Offences relating to cluster munitions—investment</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We are aware that the Convention does not contain any explicit prohibition on investment in cluster munitions. The offence provisions in clause 11(1) include a prohibition on conduct that “in any way assists, encourages, or induces another person to engage in” (11(1)(e)) various activities, including developing and producing cluster munitions. This can be interpreted to cover investing in the development or production of cluster munitions. We also understand that in respect of an offence against these provisions the general provision in the Crimes Act 1961 relating to secondary liability applies, for example, to a person who aids and abets the production of cluster munitions, or conspires with another person to produce cluster munitions.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We are not persuaded, however, that these provisions are sufficiently clear to prohibit a person or a company unequivocally from investing in cluster munitions. We consider that the bill should create an offence in order to expressly prohibit investing in cluster munitions. We recommend the insertion of new clause 11(1A) which would create an offence for when a person provides or invests funds with the intention that the funds will be used, or knowing that they are to be used in the development or the production of cluster munitions. This new offence would be subject to the same penalties as the other offences in clause 11.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We also recommend amending clause 5 to provide a definition of funds to explicitly make clear what is meant by funds in this context.</text>
        </para>
      </comm.lev1>
      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Government investment</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We have considered whether there should be a statutory prohibition on investment by Government funds in companies involved in the manufacture of cluster munitions. We have also explicitly considered the application of our recommended amendment as set out in clause 11(1A) to Crown financial institutions who might invest funds in companies involved in the manufacture of cluster munitions. We are advised that the New Zealand Superannuation Fund and the Government Superannuation Funds, the Natural Disaster Fund (Earthquake Commission) and the Accident Compensation Corporation Fund have voluntarily divested stocks in companies involved in the manufacture of such munitions. These funds also have specific policies that preclude such investments. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We interpret the bill to impose the obligations under clause 11(1A) on Crown financial institutions and therefore conclude that there is no need for a separate subclause to effect that.</text>

        <heading>Exception to offences—interoperability </heading>
        <para>
          <text>Article 21(3) of the Convention provides for an exception under which States Parties, their military personnel, or their nationals, may engage in military cooperation and operations with States not party to the Convention that “might engage” in activities prohibited to a State Party.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Clause 12(5) specifies that members of the Armed Forces do not commit an offence when carrying out their duties in operations, exercises, or other military activities with the armed forces of a State that is not party to the Convention. We consider that the wording “that engage” in clause 12(5) is limiting and does not include situations and States not party to the Convention which have the capability to engage in banned acts.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend an amendment to clause 12(5) to insert the words “has the capability to” before “engage” to ensure that the bill is consistent with the intent of the interoperability provisions in the Convention. </text>
        </para>
      </comm.lev1>
      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Authorised use of cluster munitions for certain purposes</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend amending clause 15 to delete the words “developed, produced”. As introduced, clause 15 could imply that the Minister could authorise cluster munitions to be developed and produced for certain purposes set out in clause 15. We do not consider that the development or production of cluster munitions is necessary for the purposes set out in the clause, and therefore to avoid doubt we recommend deleting these words.  </text>
