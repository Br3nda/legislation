        <para>
          <text>This Bill amends the Copyright Act 1994 by inserting a <emphasis style="italic">new Part 9A</emphasis> to establish a mandatory resale right for artists when their artistic works are resold in New Zealand. This resale right applies to artists who are residents or citizens of New Zealand, or who are nationals of reciprocating countries that offer a similar right to nationals of New Zealand.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A resale right entitles an artist to receive a resale royalty payment each time an original artistic work is resold on the secondary art market. It will apply only where ownership in a work is transferred by sale after the first transfer of ownership of that work by the artist. It will not apply to the first sale or transfer of an artistic work, and it will not apply to sales between private individuals.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A resale right will apply to an artistic work in which copyright exists, including limited editions made by the artist or made under the artist’s authority, but excluding works of architecture (being a building or a model of a building). The right is inalienable and cannot be waived, assigned, or charged. The artist who created the artistic work will hold the right regardless of whether the artist owns the copyright in the work. The right can be transmitted only on the death of the holder of the resale right.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Upon the death of the artist, the right passes in accordance with the artist’s will to the person entitled under the will; or, if there is no will, by operation of law.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The resale royalty rate will be an additional percentage of the resale price (excluding tax charged under section 8 or 11 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985). The resale right will apply only to sales that are above a specified minimum threshold in value. This threshold, and the percentage of the resale royalty rate, will be set by regulation. Royalties will be payable to living artists or to those entitled under a deceased artist’s will (or their successors), but only for as long as the resale right continues (which is of the same duration as copyright in a work, 50 years after the death of the artist).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The obligation to pay a resale royalty accrues at the time when an artistic work is sold on the secondary art market through any auction house, gallery, dealer, or other intermediary or professional involved in the business of dealing in works of art. The seller, together with the art-market intermediary or professional involved in the sale will be jointly and severally liable for payment of a resale royalty (or, if there are no agents, the seller and the buyer, as long as they are acting in the course of the business of dealing in artistic works). Liability to pay a resale royalty will arise on the completion of that sale.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The resale right, including the collection of resale royalties, will be managed through a compulsory collection system by the sole collecting agency on behalf of artists, whether or not they are members of that agency. Only this agency is entitled to request information on any resale in order to secure payment of royalties, and it must treat this information as confidential.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In return for managing the resale right, the collecting agency will be entitled to charge a fixed fee or percentage of the royalty, as determined under regulatory powers. Regulations will also provide for the appointment of the collecting agency and the rules governing its operation. These rules will include—</text>

        <para>
          <text>A resale right for artists gives recognition of an intellectual property right. It acknowledges the unique nature of artistic work, where the value is primarily in the one-off original artistic work and not in reproductions or repeated use. It is an economic right and provides an added incentive to create and the ability to derive ongoing benefit from this creation. A resale right is also a moral right recognising the continuing relationship between the creator and his or her artistic work.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Artists currently derive limited advantage from copyright legislation as it deals with reproductions or repeated use of a work. The introduction of a resale right for artists through an amendment to the Copyright Act 1994 recognises the intellectual, moral, and economic rights artists have in their artistic works, irrespective of who owns the copyright to those works.</text>

        <para>

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Status quo and problem</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>Copyright law recognises the rights of those who create other works, such as authors, composers, and musicians, to benefit from reproductions and the repeated use of their works. The introduction of a resale right for artists would enable them to access ongoing benefits as creators.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Copyright legislation deals with reproductions or repeated use of works. As artists are involved for the most part in the creation of one-off artistic work, they derive limited benefit from current copyright legislation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The value of an artistic work is derived primarily from the original piece rather than from reproductions or repeated use of its image. While there may be some royalties from the reproduction of images in auction catalogues and other publications, artists do not necessarily retain copyright or gain substantial economic benefit once their artistic work is sold.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Artistic works by young and emerging artists are usually first sold for a relatively low sale price. As an artistic work is resold over time, it often increases in value, usually in parallel to an artist’s growing body of artistic work and reputation. At the time of the original transaction, artists may be in a vulnerable position, in that their need for money may be high yet their ability to extract a good price may be low. This original transaction is the only real opportunity an artist has to benefit from the artistic work. A resale right is a means of addressing this limited access to economic benefit from the creation of an artistic work.</text>

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Alternative options</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <explnote.subhead1>Option A: Status quo remains</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>This would mean that artists would continue to derive limited advantage from copyright legislation as it deals with reproductions or repeated use of a work, whereas they are involved for the most part in the creation of one-off original pieces of artistic work. The status quo would not address these relative inequities between visual artists and other artists, in terms of the returns they are able to gain from their work. The cost under this option is to artists in terms of the lost economic benefits they potentially could have gained from their artistic work.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Option B: Additional funding to support artists in ways to be decided</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>This option would require new funding to be allocated by government, either directly or to an agency such as Creative New Zealand. Funding allocated in a general or contestable manner does not address the relative inequities between visual artists and other artists under current copyright legislation. General or contestable funding may benefit a range of visual artists and for a variety of reasons, whereas a resale right would directly benefit the artist whose artistic work was in demand and being resold, thus enabling that artist to enjoy the economic benefit from his or her artistic work.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Option C: Voluntary resale contracts</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Some artists, in New Zealand and overseas, have devised their own resale right contracts. The ability of artists to insist upon such an arrangement, however, depends on their current reputation. It disproportionately favours established artists whose artistic work is in demand. Even then they may not benefit greatly from such voluntary contracts. This is because artists can usually only attach the arrangement to artistic works which they are selling for the first time. They are unable to attach the arrangement retrospectively to artistic work that was made and sold when they were less known, even though its resale value may have subsequently increased. The legality of such contracts may also be problematic, particularly in terms of enforcing any resale right conditions beyond the initial contract between an artist and the first buyer. It would also be difficult to enforce for the full period of copyright, which is 50 years after the death of the artist. The cost to artists under this option is the lost economic benefits that they potentially could have gained from their artistic work.</text>

          <text>Specific costings have not been considered for any of these options. Options A and C would cost artists in terms of the lost economic benefits they potentially could have gained from their artistic work.

        <para>
          <text>A resale right, on the other hand, would be self-sustaining, would result directly in additional income for the artist whose artistic work was in demand and being resold, and would not incur ongoing costs to government.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Preferred option</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>A resale right is the preferred option for supporting visual artists, as it is based on the artist’s own production and creation of artistic work and their ensuing reputation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Legislating for a mandatory resale right is not intended to result in large payments for every artist. As is the nature of any right under the Copyright Act 1994, a resale right will reward those creators whose artistic works are in most demand.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A resale right is, in effect, a variation of rights that currently exist under the Copyright Act 1994, a variation that recognises the unique nature of artistic work. The relationship between copyright and a resale right is reinforced by reference to a resale right in the oldest international copyright protection treaty, the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A resale right is both an economic right, in that it provides an added incentive to create and the ability to derive ongoing benefit from this creation, and a moral right, in that it recognises a continued relationship between a creator and the work.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A resale right would apply to a graphic work, photograph, sculpture, collage, or model or a work of artistic craftsmanship not falling into the previous categories, and to any painting, drawing, diagram, map, chart, or plan, and to any engraving, etching, lithograph, woodcut, print, or similar work. It would also apply to other artistic work such as unique pieces of jewellery or furniture that have been created by a named artist. In line with the Copyright Act 1994, the right would last for the life of the artist plus 50 years. It would also be inalienable and not reassignable. The right would apply to the creator irrespective of who owned the copyright in an artistic work.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The right would apply to resales through dealers, auction houses, or other art-market intermediaries or professionals. It would apply only to sales of $500 or more. There would be no cap on the value of royalties that could be earned on each artistic work that was resold. The art market intermediary and the seller would be jointly liable for payment. The royalty would be paid at a flat rate of 5% on the hammer price or sale price. A flat rate, plus the $500 threshold, adds simplicity, reduces compliance costs, and ensures that costs associated with the resale right do not outweigh the benefits.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The collecting agency would cover administration costs by charging a commission on the resale royalties it collected. This is consistent with international practice and with other copyright agencies that administer copyright collection for other artists such as writers and musicians.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The risks identified as being associated with the introduction of the resale right are as follows:</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Compliance costs</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>One argument against the introduction of the resale right is a possible increase in compliance costs to art-market intermediaries such as dealer galleries and auction houses. Compliance costs would be kept to a minimum by introducing a flat 5% royalty rather than the staggered royalty rate introduced in Britain. The monitoring and enforcement would be undertaken by the collecting agency, including the calculation of the royalties due and the eligibility of artists. Additional compliance by art-market intermediaries would be minimal. For example, auction houses already publicly report sales in detail on websites and in catalogues. Thus, the introduction of a resale right should not prove onerous. As all art-market intermediaries would have to complete sales and financial returns for the Inland Revenue Department, the provision of information to a collecting agency should be straightforward.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Depressing the art market</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>This argument has been raised in Britain and Australia by those who oppose its introduction, but there is no conclusive evidence to establish that this effect actually occurs. There is already a range of costs inherent in the art market, such as a buyer’s premium and the commission an agent charges a seller, often both on the same artistic work. A resale right would provide the artist with a 5% share of the resale price, less the commission charged by the collecting agency. This is a relatively small amount compared to the 30%-plus typically taken by an art-market intermediary. There is similarly no conclusive evidence to show that these factors impact negatively on the price people are prepared to pay for an artistic work, or that they reduce demand for art generally. In Britain, for example, the art market has strengthened considerably since resale right regulations were introduced in February 2006. Of the 3 600 items of artistic work sold at auction in 2006 by New Zealand artists, the vast majority (99%) sold for less than $100,000. A 5% resale royalty rate is unlikely, therefore, to have much more than a minimal, if any, impact on the resale value of artistic work sold in this country.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Art market moving offshore</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Those opposed to the resale right have argued that the sale of artistic work will be relocated to countries that do not have a resale right, to avoid paying the resale royalty. It was asserted that this would be an issue in Britain where it was feared the sale of artistic work would divert to Switzerland or New York. There is no evidence that that has occurred. In New Zealand the closest alternative market would be Australia, but there is little risk of diversion as the market for New Zealand art is primarily locally based. Nearly 90% of artistic work sold at auctions in Australasia over the past decade by New Zealand artists was sold in this country. The costs involved in relocating art to a new market would act as a further disincentive.</text>

          <text>The discussion paper <amend.in quote="1">A Resale Royalty Right for Visual Artists: Options for its possible application to New Zealand</amend.in> was released in April 2007. Over 3 000 hard copies were distributed and it was placed on the Ministry for Culture and Heritage’s website. Submissions were sought from all interested parties, including artists, art collectors, art dealers, galleries and auctioneers, iwi, secondhand dealers, museums, art institutions, and any other person or group with an interest in the buying or selling of artistic work. Respondents had until 22 June 2007 to make a submission.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Two hundred and two submissions were received. Of these, 126 respondents (62%) favoured the establishment of a mandatory resale right in New Zealand, 6 (3%) were neutral or uncertain, and 70 (35%) were opposed.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Artists and art groups made 56% of these submissions, followed by art collectors 11%, secondhand dealers 8.5%, and dealer galleries 8%. The remainder of the submissions were from copyright collection agencies, museums or art institutions, auction houses, academics, and others.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The following agencies were also consulted and account taken of their views: Ministry of Economic Development, The Treasury, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Te Puni Kōkiri, Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Inland Revenue Department, and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. Creative New Zealand and Te Papa were consulted on the discussion paper.</text>
