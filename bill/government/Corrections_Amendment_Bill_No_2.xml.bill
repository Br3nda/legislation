          <text>This Bill makes a number of amendments to the Corrections Act 2004 (the <def-term id="DLM1098302">Act</def-term>) that are intended to improve the operations of the corrections system. The Act is relatively new and is generally working well. However, some amendments are needed to address issues that have arisen during the time since its passage. The proposed changes add to the existing framework and help give better effect to existing provisions. There have been 2 particular drivers for the changes included in the Bill—technological advances in forms of electronic communication since the passage of the Act, and the need to incrementally improve the control of contraband in prisons.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Contraband and drug use</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Contraband is a major concern in the prison system, with items such as drugs, alcohol, money, offensive weapons, and mobile telephones having the capacity to produce serious problems for prison management. Such items can present a direct threat to staff and prisoners, lead to stand-over tactics and assaults, and allow prisoners to subvert prison controls and organise further criminal activities outside the prison. A failure to control their entry and use in prisons also has a serious negative effect on perceptions, especially by staff and prisoners but also by the public, of the Department’s capacity to manage and control prisons.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In recent years a number of factors have impacted on the control of contraband in prisons, including the growth in the prison population and consequent increase in inexperienced staff members, gang involvement in prisons, drug and alcohol use and dependency, and the changing nature of contraband, with both drugs and electronic devices becoming smaller and easier to conceal.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A range of legislative and operational measures are already in place to reduce both the demand for contraband and its supply, and to improve the effectiveness of drug and alcohol testing. Operational steps that are currently being taken or planned for include—</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Prisoner mail</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>It is clear that letters containing threats, plans for further offending, and other prohibited communications are leaving prisons. Current legislation does not permit prison staff to screen prisoners’ mail without a reasonable-grounds test being met, and in most cases there are, on the face of it, no reasonable grounds to suspect that a particular letter may need to be withheld. The Act is inconsistent in its treatment of prisoners’ mail and telephone calls. All telephone calls may be screened and unlawful communications may be recorded and passed to the police or other enforcement agencies. In the absence of tighter controls, prisoners’ mail is likely to be seen as a relatively risk-free way to communicate prohibited messages once cellphones are clamped down on.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill provides that all prisoner mail, other than mail that is currently exempt, can be read, but only for the purpose of determining whether mail should be withheld under section 108(1) (for example, on the grounds that it endangers the safety or welfare of any person).</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Emergency management</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>At present the Crown and departmental agents and contractors may be liable for any breach of the Act or its regulations that is reasonably necessary or unavoidable during an epidemic, civil defence, or prison-specific emergency. In addition, it is unclear whether successful actions could be taken against the Crown for the continued detention of a prisoner past his or her release date while a prison is covered by a quarantine order issued under the Health Act 1956 during an epidemic emergency situation. There is no certainty that the provisions of the Health Act 1956 will override other legislation or that the common law doctrine of necessity will protect the Department from damages claims for actions taken in good faith in an emergency situation, both in respect of prisoners and others who happen to be in a prison when an emergency is declared.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Providing protection from liability during an emergency would provide some certainty and clarity around the steps that may be taken to manage prisons in the event of any emergency situation.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Information sharing</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Act provides for the release to the police of certain information on highest-risk offenders to assist in monitoring their compliance with release conditions. There are 3 problems with these provisions. First, the set of information may not allow the police on all occasions to adequately identify a particular prisoner so that the prisoner can be monitored. Second, the purpose for releasing the information, and the restriction of that information release only to the police, does not allow for consideration of the prisoner’s reintegration into the community. Third, the disclosure of information is limited to the police and it may be useful on occasion to also involve social agencies so that a full range of reintegration issues can be addressed.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill allows information to be disclosed that is sufficient to allow a co-ordinated response by the Department, the police, and where appropriate, relevant social agencies. This is so that the best arrangements for the placement of a prisoner into the community can be made, taking into account the interests of the prisoner and community safety.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Unauthorised communications with prisoners</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Sections 141 and 143 of the Act include offence provisions in relation to unauthorised communications with prisoners. These provisions do not prohibit unauthorised communications with a prisoner that may prejudice the well-being of a victim of a crime committed by that prisoner. This could result, for example, from the publication of details of the crime.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill provides for prejudice to the well-being of the victim as an additional ground for the offence of unauthorised communications with prisoners.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Firearms for animal and pest control</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Act provides that nothing in the Act authorises an officer or a staff member to carry, possess, or use any firearm. There are, however, circumstances on prison farms and nurseries when it is desirable for staff members to be able to use firearms in the course of their duties—for example, putting down badly injured or ill animals, or for pest control of rabbits and hares. It is costly and impractical for the Department to alternatively make use of veterinarians for putting down severely injured animals.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill provides for an amendment to allow the chief executive to empower staff members with a firearms licence to possess, carry, and use firearms, but only for the purposes of humanely killing animals, pest control, and for specified prison industry purposes, such as pet food production. Appropriate safeguards are provided for the use and storage of these firearms to ensure that they do not become available to prisoners.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Exemptions for communion wine</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>It is not lawful under the Act and the Corrections Regulations 2005 (the <def-term id="DLM1098304">regulations</def-term>) for a prison chaplain or priest to bring wine into a prison for the purpose of celebrating Mass or Holy Communion. It is also an offence against discipline for a prisoner to consume communion wine (or any alcohol) without the authority of a medical officer.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill allows wine to be provided by prison chaplains and ministers of religion at church services attended by prisoners. This is consistent with freedom of religion and other rights of minorities affirmed under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Forfeiture of items</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Act establishes a process whereby items connected to an offence can be seized. If items are seized from a person who is not a prisoner and the person is convicted of the offence, the Act also states that the item is forfeit to the Crown unless a Court orders otherwise. There is no equivalent forfeiture provision for items related to an offence against discipline committed by a prisoner. Additionally, there is nothing expressly authorising the Department to use or otherwise dispose of items that are forfeit.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill would allow the forfeiture of items that have been seized in relation to offences and disciplinary offences (with appropriate protections), and empower the Department to use and dispose of forfeited items.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Cellphone jamming</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The illicit use of cellphones in prisons has become increasingly difficult to manage through traditional search and seizure techniques. Within prison walls, cellphones have been used by prisoners to organise further criminal offending, to threaten and harass witnesses and others, and to arrange escapes.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Entry solutions, such as scanner devices at the entrance to a prison, do not completely prevent illicit cellphone activity. Disabling and interference (jamming) solutions appear to be the most effective method for dealing with the problem because they can completely eliminate cellphone coverage within prison boundaries.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Department, Telecom, and Vodafone have been working together to arrive at solutions for monitoring and preventing cellphone use in prisons through electronic means.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Three solutions have been selected for implementation—a hard-wired detection solution, a disabling solution, and an interference solution. The suitability of a solution to a particular prison site will be fully assessed in the next stages of the project.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill would provide an explicit authority for the Department to intercept, monitor, detect, disable, disrupt, and interfere with radio-based telecommunications within a prison in order to stop or prevent transmissions from cellphones (and other electronic communication devices), but only where this does not prevent the legitimate use of cellphones outside prison boundaries. The proposed amendment would state that no solution may be implemented that would result in harmful interference (as defined by the Radiocommunications Act 1989) outside prison boundaries. This means that members of the public would be able to use their cellphones outside prison boundaries.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Amendments are also proposed to authorise any incidental monitoring and to enable the Department to take the appropriate action if, for example, a prisoner was overheard making plans, by way of a cellphone, to commit a crime.</text>

          <text>One additional cost that might arise from the proposals is that the greater penalties and new offence relating to contraband (in particular, electronic communication devices) might lead to longer sentences and an increased number of prisoners. This is expected to be marginal as only 1 successful case is required for the new penalties to have an impact.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>These alternatives involve an increase in resources or further restrictions on the rights of prisoners and visitors. They are broad-brush in approach, involving both those that are perceived as a risk and those that are not. An across the board limitation on the frequency of visitors is likely to be seen as an unnecessary restriction on the rights of prisoners and their families.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Prisoners’ mail</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Continuation of the status quo means that there would be restrictions on the ability of prison staff to screen prisoners’ mail. Unlawful and harmful letters would continue to leave prisons.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to permit authorised prison staff to screen mail for the purpose of detecting letters that need to be withheld or passed to the police. Privileged communications to lawyers, members of Parliament, and official agencies would not be read.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Emergency management</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Under the status quo there is no certainty that the common law doctrine of necessity will protect the Department from claims for damages relating to actions taken in good faith in an emergency situation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Providing protection from liability during an emergency would provide some certainty and clarity around the steps that may be taken to manage prisons in the event of any emergency situation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to provide exemption from liability for the Crown for actions taken in good faith during an emergency situation (due to an epidemic, civil defence, or prison specific situation). This is considered necessary in the unique prison environment to allow staff to manage in difficult circumstances and to avoid large numbers of costly civil actions for damages against the Department.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In addition, without a legislative amendment, there will be a conflict between the provisions of the Parole Act 2002 and the Health Act 1956 (which provides for the detention of persons subject to a quarantine or isolation order during an epidemic emergency). The preferred option is to avoid additional actions for damages by making it clear that ex-prisoners will be required to remain in a prison in these circumstances.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Information sharing</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The status quo would mean that highest-risk offenders would continue to be released from prison without the benefit of steps being able to be put in place that increase the likelihood of successful reintegration and policing efforts to support a safer community.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to amend the Act to allow sufficient information to be shared in advance of the prisoner’s release with the police and relevant social agencies for the purposes of monitoring compliance with the conditions of their release or home detention, and assisting with the rehabilitation and reintegration of highest-risk prisoners into the community. This would be done by way of information sharing provisions modelled on sections 182A to 182D of the Act, which deals with information sharing in respect of child sex offenders.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Unauthorised communications with prisoners</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The status quo provides no specific protections for victims, while the proposed amendment would include prejudice to the well-being of the victim as an additional ground for an offence.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to add prejudice to the well-being of victims as an additional ground for the offence of unauthorised communications with prisoners.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Use of firearms</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The status quo means that the Department would need to make alternative, off-site arrangements for the destruction of animals for prison industry (pet food) purposes, and call veterinarians in from some distance to put down severely injured animals. This would be costly, but also might be impractical. For example, it may not always be possible for a vet to travel from Taupo to Tongariro/Rangipo in a timely way, bearing in mind the operational requirements of the prison and the welfare of the animal.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to amend the Act to allow the chief executive of the Department to authorise staff members to possess, carry, and use firearms but only for the purposes of specified prison industries, the humane killing of animals, and pest control.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Exemptions for communion wine</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The current situation is problematic because of the prohibitions on the consumption of alcohol in prisons set out in the Act.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to provide an exception for wine that is brought in and consumed in prisons during the celebration of the Eucharist. This is consistent with the freedom of religion and other rights of minorities affirmed under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Forfeiture of items</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The current position means that items that are seized and forfeited cannot be disposed of by the Department, and that items related to offences against discipline by prisoners cannot be seized.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to allow the forfeiture of items that have been seized (with appropriate protections), and empower the Department to use and dispose of forfeited items.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Cellphone jamming</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Act provides no explicit authority for the Department or its agents to detect, monitor, disable, disrupt, and interfere with wireless communications (typically cellphone calls) within prisons.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to amend the Act to allow the Department to jam cellphone communications within a prison. Legislative protections for the public would be included and provide that no cellphone jamming solution may be put in place that resulted in harmful interference (as defined in section 3 of the Radiocommunications Act 1989) outside prison boundaries.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>No legislative amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1989 to provide for departmental access to spectrum are proposed at this time. The necessary arrangements with spectrum right holders will be made according to the licensing arrangements of that Act.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Implementation and review</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The Department is putting in place a formalised data collection and management system that will provide better quality and timely information to allow the success of these legislative and related operational issues to be monitored.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In relation to cellphone jamming, subject to funding, the joint project between the Department, Telecom, and Vodafone will move to the next phase and roll out the 3 preferred solutions to suitable prison sites. The project team will review the effectiveness of each solution and report on any matters associated with implementation.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Consultation</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>Relevant consultation has been carried out with the Treasury, the Ministry of Justice, the New Zealand Police, the Ministry of Social Development, Housing New Zealand Corporation, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the Privacy Commissioner, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the Ministry of Economic Development. Consultation has been carried out with Telecom and Vodafone over the cellphone jamming proposal.</text>
