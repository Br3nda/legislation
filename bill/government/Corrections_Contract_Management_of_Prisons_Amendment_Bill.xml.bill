        <para>
          <text>It is Government policy to allow for the competitive tendering of prison management on a case-by-case basis.  Amendments are required to the Corrections Act 2004 to allow this to occur.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Opening up prison management to contractors provides an opportunity for innovation and change in the way in which prisons in New Zealand are operated.  Providing for prisons to be run effectively and efficiently by contract managers also enables the Government to look for cost savings in the overall delivery of prison services.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>New Zealand already has some experience of contract managed prisons.  Auckland Central Remand Prison (<def-term id="DLM1888302">ACRP</def-term>) was managed under contract from 2000 to 2005.  During that time ACRP made a number of improvements that were subsequently adopted by the Department of Corrections (the <def-term id="DLM1888303">department</def-term>), and the experience is generally regarded as having been positive.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Government wants to build on this experience and develop effective working relationships between private and public sector providers which facilitate the exchange of ideas and initiatives and provide for innovation and excellence in penal reform.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>During its previous experience with the contract management of ACRP, the department did not experience any difficulty with the law, and found that it facilitated an effective contractual and working relationship.  The legislative provisions that governed that relationship therefore provide the basis for this Bill.  The Bill has updated the language of the previous legislation that permitted contract management of prisons (namely sections 4A to 4L of the Penal Institutions Act 1954) for consistency with the Corrections Act 2004 and to modernise some of the terminology and drafting.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There are 4 areas in which the Bill makes substantive changes to the previous law.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill is silent as to the duration of the contract period, leaving this to be specified in the contract itself.  This approach provides the bargaining parties with more flexibility and enables the chief executive of the department (the <def-term id="DLM1888304">chief executive</def-term>) to negotiate the duration of the contract alongside other contract variables such as cost, provision of programmes, risk management, and return on investment, rather than tying the parties into a legislative time frame that may not meet the Government’s objectives.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill requires the chief executive to impose a contractual obligation on any contractor to comply with all relevant international obligations and standards.  This ensures that all New Zealand prisons will continue to meet international standards on the treatment and welfare of prisoners.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill requires contractors to comply with instructions and guidelines issued by the chief executive under section196 of the Corrections Act 2004.  This replaces the previous requirement for contractors to comply with operational standards that have been phased out, and have consequently been revoked.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill provides for existing staff who are members of the Government Superannuation Fund (the <def-term id="DLM1888305">GSF</def-term>) to continue their entitlements under that fund if they are required to transfer from a publicly run prison to a prison run by a private-sector provider.   Because a small number of long-serving staff are currently members of the GSF, the Bill provides protection for those who transfer to a prison contract manager, and ensures that they are not unduly disadvantaged.  This provision will apply only in the event that departmental staff who contribute to the GSF transfer to or between contract prisons.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill also contains a small number of minor amendments that are consequential to the changes described above.  No substantive changes to other Acts are proposed.</text>

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Status quo and problem</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>Prior to the Corrections Act 2004, the prison system was governed by the Penal Institutions Act 1954.  This was amended in 1995 to enable the Crown to enter into contracts for the management of prisons.  In 1999 the Department of Corrections entered into a contract with the GEO Group for the management of Auckland Central Remand Prison (<emphasis style="bold">ACRP</emphasis>) for an initial period of 5 years from July 2000 to July 2005.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The 1995 provisions were repealed by the Corrections Act 2004.  Sections 198 and 209 of the Corrections Act 2004 explicitly prevent any person from extending the existing contract with the GEO Group, and from entering into any further contracts with the same or other providers. It is currently Government policy to allow for the competitive tendering of prison management.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Some overseas literature on publicly delivered prison services notes that there can be a lack of incentives to innovate, take risks in the delivery of programmes, and be cost-effective.  Several jurisdictions have used contract prison management to attempt to improve outcomes and cost-effectiveness.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Corrections Act 2004 must be amended to implement Government policy and allow the tendering of prison management on a case-by-case basis.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Objectives</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The objective of this policy is to allow the Department of Corrections to tender and contract for prison management on a case-by-case basis.  This will allow the possibility of a contracted prison manager being able to introduce innovation, improve service performance, and be more cost-effective.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Alternative option</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The policy of allowing prison management to be contracted cannot be implemented other than by way of legislation.  The only alternative to the measures in the Bill is to take no action, which would be inconsistent with Government policy.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Preferred option</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to repeal the provisions of the Corrections Act 2004 that prevent contract management of prisons and amend the Act to include similar provisions to those passed in 1995 to empower this.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The experience of contract managed prisons internationally is varied, and comparisons are complicated by the variety of procurement methods used.  In general, it is possible to say that cost savings have been gained from the use of the private sector in managing prisons in other jurisdictions, but empirical support for the service performance of contract prisons is mixed (even within jurisdictions).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Overseas experience suggests that there is a link between the success of the contractor and the quality of the contracting and contract management process.  There are a number of lessons from other jurisdictions that will assist in getting good contracting outcomes in New Zealand. In particular:</text>
          <list>

            <item>

              <para>
                <text>contracts that are too long without being able to be refreshed can prevent new and effective best practice correctional practices from being introduced.</text>
              </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The experience internationally and at ACRP suggests that the ability to obtain benefits from contract prisons will lie in the implementation of the policy.  While providing an appropriate legislative framework is important, what will determine the effectiveness of a contract prison policy is the quality of the procurement, contracting, and contract management process.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The department did not experience any difficulty with the previous law and found that it facilitated an effective contractual and working relationship with the contractor.  The 1995 provisions, with appropriate transitional and consequential provisions, are therefore largely suitable as the basis for amending the Corrections Act 2004.  The use of the 1995 provisions reduces some risks that might arise from legislating in a relatively new area in New Zealand law by using provisions that have worked well in the past.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Other important parts of the regulatory structure for the management of prisons contained in the Corrections Act 2004 will apply to prisons managed under contract, without further legislative change.  These include the rights of access and powers of prison inspectors, Visiting Justices, and other statutory officers, and the process by which search and coercive powers are used.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There are some areas where changes from the 1995 legislation are needed.  The first is that the 1995 amendment to the Penal Institutions Act 1954 required the contract to run for an initial period of 5 years, with an option to renew for a further 2 years if both parties agreed.  This time period reflected a concern that this was the first contract prison in New Zealand and that a degree of care and prudence was needed.  Given the experience with contracting between 2000 and 2005 at ACRP, this level of restriction on contract length is no longer needed.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The legislation is silent on contract length, and allows this to be dealt with in the contract itself.  The major advantages of this are that—</text>
          <list>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>it provides the Crown and potential bidders with greater flexibility in negotiating contract length alongside other contract variables such as cost, staff transfer and management, and programme development:</text>
              </para>
            </item>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>the Crown may receive a wider range of bids if there is seen to be some flexibility in contract length:</text>
              </para>
            </item>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>the prison or prisons that might become contract managed have not yet been identified.  At this stage it is not possible to be definitive that a term of 5 years will be sufficient to allow a bidder to address all of the issues that might arise at a given location.  This will only become apparent when a greater degree of due diligence is carried out.</text>
              </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Staff transferring to a contract prison manager on the same terms and conditions should, where appropriate, continue to be members of the Government Superannuation Fund.  Section 16 of the New Zealand Railways Corporation Restructuring Act 1990 has been used as the basis for a legislative provision to empower this.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The 1995 legislation required the contractor to comply with “operational standards”.  These standards were a form of tertiary legislation that were not continued by the Corrections Act 2004.  The legislation therefore provides that the contractor must comply with guidelines and instructions issued by the chief executive under section 196 of the Act.  </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There is one other substantive change from the 1995 legislation.  This is to place an obligation on the chief executive of the Department of Corrections to impose a contractual obligation on any contractor to comply with all relevant international obligations and standards.  This will ensure that any obligations and standards relating to prisons can be easily incorporated into a contract.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Implementation and review</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>It is intended that legislation be introduced by the end of March 2009 and passed this year.  This would then allow competitive tendering for the management of prisons to be carried out. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The legislation contains provisions that place a requirement on the Department of Corrections to include objectives and performance standards in the management contracts, and to report on the management of every contract prison in the Department’s Annual Report.  The legislation also contains a requirement that at least every 3 months the contractor is required to report to the chief executive of the Department of Corrections on a range of matters.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The contract bidding process and the subsequent reporting structure would allow an assessment to be made of the extent to which the contract management of prisons offers advantages over departmental management.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Consultation</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The Department of Corrections has consulted on this paper with the Ministry of Justice, State Services Commission, Department of Labour, Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Treasury, Te Puni Kōkiri, Ministry of Women’s Affairs, New Zealand Police, Ministry of Social Development, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, and Government Superannuation Fund Authority.  The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has been informed.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Consultation has not been carried out with any other group.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The only issue raised during consultation was by Te Puni Kōkiri.  Te Puni Kōkiri considered that, given the level of investment by the Government in prison management, explicit and measurable performance objectives and standards relating to the rehabilitation and reduction of recidivism of Māori inmates must be legislated for and regularly reported on.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Department of Corrections does not consider that this change is necessary.  The proposed legislation contains requirements that performance objectives should be specified in the contract, and already imposes significant reporting obligations on the contractor.  No change to the legislation is recommended, and Te Puni Kōkiri has been advised of this view.</text>
