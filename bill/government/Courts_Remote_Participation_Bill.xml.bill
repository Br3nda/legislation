        <para>
          <text>The purpose of the bill is to enable more use of audio-visual links (AVL) in New Zealand courts. A number of pieces of legislation, including the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, require defendants and witnesses <quote.in>to be brought before the courts</quote.in> or <quote.in>to be present in court</quote.in>. The courts have interpreted these provisions to require a person to be physically present in the courtroom. This has limited the use of AVL to those cases where it has been specifically mandated by the law.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The bill sets out an overarching legislative framework for the use of AVL, and would apply to every enactment in New Zealand law. The significant features of the bill as introduced are as follows: </text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Use of audio-visual links in civil proceedings</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend replacing clause 7 with new clause 7 to provide that, after considering whether the parties consent and the criteria in clause 5 for determining whether AVL should be used, a judicial officer or Registrar is allowed to determine that AVL should be used where the parties have consented to its use. As introduced, clause 7(1) merely says that AVL may be used in civil proceedings where all the parties consent to its use. We have two concerns about this provision. The first is that it would have implications for court administration, as clause 7(1) does not include a mechanism to ensure that the court is informed that the parties have agreed to the use of AVL. The second is that clause 7(1) does not require the parties to take into account wider considerations, such as the interests of other participants in the proceedings, before agreeing to the use of AVL.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We heard concern that clause 7 of the bill as introduced would not allow a child in Family Court proceedings to withhold consent to the use of AVL, as they are not participants in the proceedings. We do not recommend amending clause 7 to refer to particular types of proceedings, such as Family Court proceedings, as this would be inconsistent with the intent of the bill. The bill is intended to provide an overarching legislative framework to apply to all court proceedings. However, we consider that our proposed new clause 7 should alleviate submitters’ concerns by requiring the judicial officer or Registrar, when determining whether AVL should be used, to have regard to the criteria set out in clause 5 of the bill as introduced. Amongst other things, these criteria require the judicial officer or Registrar to consider the nature of the proceedings (for example, whether they are Family Court proceedings) and any other relevant matter (such as whether a lawyer representing a child or counsel appointed to assist the Family Court consents to the use of AVL). Our proposed new clause 7 would ensure that the views of the lawyer representing the child and counsel assisting the court could be taken into account in determining whether to use AVL.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Clause 7 of the bill as introduced would allow only judicial officers to be involved in determining whether AVL could be used in civil proceedings. Proposed new clause 7 would also allow Registrars to determine whether AVL could be used. This would recognise the role of Registrars in some civil proceedings. They have the power, for example, to examine witnesses, hear and determine applications to extend or shorten the time, adjourn hearings, and make orders on interlocutory applications. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>As introduced, clause 7(2) refers to a judicial officer in civil proceedings deciding whether AVL may be used in those proceedings. For practical reasons we consider it preferable for any judicial officer or Registrar to be allowed to make a decision before the hearing about the use of AVL. A similar amendment is needed to clause 9(1), which relates to a decision to use AVL in a criminal substantive matter. </text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Use of audio-visual links in criminal procedural matters</heading>
        <para>
          <text>Clause 8 of the bill as introduced sets out the situations in which AVL may be used for the appearance of a participant in a criminal procedural matter. We recommend replacing clause 8(1) with new clause 8(1) to require that the use of AVL be considered in criminal procedural matters if the necessary technology is available. We note that the intention of clause 8 was to create a presumption in favour of the use of AVL in criminal procedural matters. Our recommended amendment is aimed at preserving this objective by ensuring that AVL should be the first option considered for criminal procedural matters, unless the technology was not available. In practice our amendment would mean that where the technology was available, the judicial officer or Registrar would be required to consider, using the criteria set out in clauses 5 and 6 and having regard to any objections by a party to the proceedings, whether any one or more participants in a criminal procedural matter should appear by AVL.</text>
        </para>
        <comm.lev2>
          <heading>Use of AVL in substantive criminal proceedings</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We heard significant arguments against the use of AVL in substantive criminal proceedings, on the basis that its use would be incompatible with international human rights instruments. In particular, concern was raised that in respect of criminal proceedings the bill does not comply with sections 23 and 25 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.<footnote id="DLM3005001"><para><text>  Section 23 outlines the rights of a person who has been detained or arrested under any enactment; section 25 outlines the minimum rights of a person charged with a criminal offence.</text></para></footnote></text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>In the light of the concerns expressed, we investigated the use of AVL in court proceedings in overseas jurisdictions. Our findings can be summarised as follows.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Canada’s Federal Criminal Code permits a defendant to appear by AVL <quote.in>for any part of the trial other than a part in which evidence of a witness is taken</quote.in> with the parties’ consent.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>In the United States, AVL is used in several state courts for remote first appearances and arraignment.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>In Australia, AVL is used to some degree in all states, for particular kinds of proceedings. For example:</text>

              <item>
                <label auto.number="no" denominator="no">•</label>
                <para>
                  <text>In Queensland AVL may be used for arraignments and sentencing, with the parties’ consent.</text>
                </para>
              </item>
              <item>
                <label auto.number="no" denominator="no">•</label>
                <para>
                  <text>In Victoria, the physical appearance of a defendant is not required, unless the court directs otherwise, for proceedings including bail, adjournment, subsequent remands in custody, status hearings, and committal proceedings. A defendant must appear physically before the court for the first appearance after arrest, inquiries into fitness to stand trial, committal hearings, trials, sentencing hearings, and hearings on appeals; however, if the parties consent and it is consistent with justice and reasonable practice, a court may direct videoconferencing in any of these proceedings. </text>
                </para>
              </item>
              <item>
                <label auto.number="no" denominator="no">•</label>
                <para>
                  <text>In New South Wales defendants must, unless the court directs otherwise, appear by videoconference for a number of proceedings, including bail, interlocutory proceedings, adjournment, and arraignment. A defendant must appear physically before the court for the first appearance after arrest, inquiries into fitness to stand trial, committal hearings, and trials. </text>
                </para>
              </item>
            </list>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>In the United Kingdom, Virtual Courts are being trialled in London and Kent. A Virtual Court hearing can occur where an accused is in custody and the matter relates to a preliminary or sentencing hearing. A recent amendment to the Crimes and Disorder Act 1998 removed the requirement for the accused to consent to a Virtual Court hearing.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Our investigations indicate countries take a variety of different approaches in determining whether to allow the use of AVL for the appearance of an accused at trial or in substantive criminal proceedings. Furthermore we found in many of these jurisdictions the consent of the accused in substantive criminal proceedings is often, but not always, required. </text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Consistent with historical practice and notions of a court, an accused’s right to participate in proceedings has commonly been equated with the need for them to be physically present at the proceeding. However, we were advised that an accused’s physical presence alone does not safeguard their right to participate in a trial, but merely provides them with the opportunity to participate in the proceedings. We were advised that the use of AVL would not necessarily infringe on an accused person’s right to a fair trial. With appropriate legislative mechanisms and minor modifications to courtroom behaviour (for example, requirng judges to actively check that defendants are following the proceedings), an accused’s fair trial rights could be safeguarded if AVL were to be used. </text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The majority of the committee are satisfied that the bill provides legislative mechanisms that would protect the rights of the accused. The general and specific criteria set out in clauses 5, 6, and 9 are intended to ensure that rigorous consideration is given to whether, and to what extent, appearance by AVL would limit or enhance an accused’s opportunity to participate in the proceedings. We further understand that the obligation under section 6 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act to give all enactments an interpretation consistent with the rights and freedoms contained in that Act would further protect the fair trial rights of the accused in any proceedings.</text>

        <para>
          <text>We recommend amending the definition of <quote.in>participant</quote.in> in clause 3 to include the Registrar presiding over the proceedings. The definition of <quote.in>participant</quote.in> in the bill as introduced did not include Registrars, which fails to recognise that a Registrar may preside over proceedings and therefore might appear by AVL. </text>

        <heading>Judicial officer or Registrar may make direction</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend inserting new clause 10A to require that the determination of a judicial officer or Registrar as to whether AVL should be used in particular proceedings may be recorded as a direction by the judicial officer or Registrar. This would provide for uniformity and consistency in the recording and managing of the courts’ decisions. A court direction would be recorded in the Case Management System and on the court file, authorising the court administration to act on the judicial officer’s or Registrar’s decision. </text>

        <heading>Amendment to the Evidence Act 2006</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend amending clause 18 to make it clear that nothing in the bill would affect the ability of any party to apply for evidence to be given in an alternative way under section 103 of the Evidence Act. As introduced, clause 18 is not sufficiently clear that, while the bill is intended to be the primary statute under which applications should be made for the use of AVL in the courtroom, the ability to apply for evidence to be given in an alternative way under the Evidence Act would not be overridden by the provisions in the bill. The purpose of clause 18 is to recognise that in some cases it might be more appropriate for parties to apply under the Evidence Act for evidence to be given in an alternative way, possibly in conjunction with the use of AVL.</text>

        <heading>New Zealand Labour view</heading>
        <para>
          <text>Central to the right of an accused, who may be innocent, to a fair trial is his or her right to personally attend their own trial. This is a fundamental civil liberty. We agree that interlocutory or preliminary hearings on some occasions can be held by audio visual conference without causing prejudice to the accused. We do not accept there is justification for allowing such a process to be imposed, without the consent of the accused, for a substantive hearing. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We did not receive any cogent evidence to show that this erosion of the right of the accused to be present at trial was necessary. There is no evidence of trials being frustrated by the current rule. The clearly predominant and longstanding practice in overseas jurisdictions like Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States reinforces our view that the accused ought to have the right to attend his or her own trial.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This legislation represents a serious incursion into the civil liberties and protection that all New Zealand citizens currently have to protect themselves against the actions of the State. The submissions from the New Zealand Law Society and the Human Rights Commission are correct and should not be ignored. We strongly disapprove of this aspect of the bill and on this basis will be opposing the bill as a whole. </text>
