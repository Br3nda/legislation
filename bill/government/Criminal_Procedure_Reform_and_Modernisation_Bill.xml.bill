        <para>
          <text>The approach taken to offence categorisation recognises that the right to a jury trial is fundamentally the right of the defence, and that decisions regarding fact-finder (Judge or jury) should largely be independent of decisions about the jurisdiction in which an offence should be heard (High Court or District Court). Regard has also been had to the need to ensure an appropriate balance of workload between District Courts and the High Court. This has led to a new process for transferring the case to the High Court for trial. Some category 3 offences, as identified in a protocol developed by the Chief High Court Judge and Chief District Court Judge, will be routinely considered for transfer to the High Court. If a category 3 offence is not in the protocol, either the prosecution or defence may apply to have the case transferred to the High Court. Transfer decisions will have the input of both the District Court and the High Court, with the High Court finally deciding the matter.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Offences have been allocated to category 4 primarily on the basis that they are of such high public or symbolic importance that they must be tried in the High Court by a jury (for example, murder and related offences) or that, because of their nature, there would be questions of fairness and impartiality if they were tried by a Judge alone (for example, offences related to judicial bribery and corruption).</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There is some limited ability in these cases for parties to make pre-trial applications in regard to evidence admissibility. The current practice is for admissibility issues to be addressed during a Judge-alone trial. However, given the wide range of offences that fall within category 3, it is likely that more serious and complex cases will be heard before a Judge alone. In some of these cases it may be more convenient or fairer for admissibility applications to be dealt with before trial.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Jury trials</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Category 3 offences when jury trial is elected, and category 4 offences, will follow a more complex procedure than that which applies to Judge-alone cases. This procedure incorporates many of the current processes that apply to jury trials and that have been developed with a jury in mind. These include a greater ability to make pre-trial applications before the trial to ensure that a jury is not inconvenienced by unresolved matters being dealt with at trial.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill abolishes the step of committing a case for trial. Historically, the primary function of committal, which was conducted by way of an oral hearing, was to establish whether there was sufficient evidence to put the defendant on trial. Recent legislative changes to the committal process now require the prosecution to file formal written statements and for committal to then be automatic unless the defence successfully applies for an oral evidence order within 14 days. This has made the committal step largely redundant. The critical elements associated with committal, which are the requirement for the prosecutor to file formal statements and the ability to apply for oral evidence orders, remain. These mechanisms will continue to act as a filter to identify cases where there is insufficient evidence to justify a trial.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill also provides greater flexibility about how oral evidence is to be taken. Rather than always hearing oral evidence in a courtroom in front of a Judge, oral evidence may be taken in a courtroom or elsewhere by a Judge, Community Magistrates, or Justices of the Peace, or by a Registrar. It is envisaged that oral evidence will be taken by a Judge when it is being considered as part of other pre-trial applications, in particular, pre-trial applications relating to the admissibility of evidence. In addition, the Bill introduces greater flexibility about the form that formal statements must take. Rather than require all formal statements to be in writing, it enables a statement to be recorded in any medium.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Pleas and elections</explnote.subhead1>
        <explnote.subhead2>Pleas</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill changes the approach to taking pleas. Until a recent Practice Note—<emphasis style="italic">Committal Procedure in the District Court</emphasis> (District Court, June 2009), defendants in indictable cases were not routinely asked to plead until after committal. This has meant that proceedings could progress to a relatively late stage, despite the defendant’s intention to plead guilty. The Bill enables the courts to ask all defendants to plead after they have had the opportunity to obtain legal advice and have received initial disclosure from the prosecution. If a defendant fails to enter a plea, a not guilty plea will be deemed to have been entered.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Election of jury trial</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill establishes a presumption that a category 3 offence will be tried by a Judge sitting alone, unless the defendant elects trial by jury. Defendants will be required to elect at the time a not guilty plea is entered. They will only be able to make a late election or withdraw their election with the leave of the court when specified circumstances exist. This will ensure fairness while preventing unnecessary delay arising from the need to switch between procedural tracks when election decisions are changed.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Because the nature of the issues may change before the trial, there is an opportunity for the defence to amend the issues that have been identified with the court’s leave up until the commencement of the trial. However, it is appropriate that some restriction is placed on the ability to do so, to enable the prosecution to prepare for the trial with some certainty as to what the disputed issues will be. The Bill therefore provides that the court should only give leave if it is necessary to do so to secure a fair trial.</text>

          <text>The Bill provides authority for the court to give an indication of the sentence a defendant is likely to receive if he or she pleads guilty at that time. While sentence indications are given routinely in the District Courts, there is currently no statutory authority for them and they are seldom given by the High Court. With the safeguards included in the Bill, the provisions relating to sentence indications will provide certainty and clarity in the law, encourage their use, and assist in resolving more cases earlier (as defendants can be more inclined to plead guilty if broadly aware of the sentence they are likely to face).</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Specific issues with criminal procedure</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>A range of specific issues are addressed by the Bill. Many of these issues are of a relatively minor or technical legal nature and are intended to remove uncertainty and inconsistencies, or to codify developments in the common law. More significant issues addressed by the Bill include the following:</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Representative charges</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>While a charge should normally relate to a single offence, the Bill allows for representative charges in 2 circumstances. The first circumstance is where there has been repeated conduct over a period of time but it is not possible to fully particularise the individual charges. This largely codifies current practice and the common law that has developed since the issuing of a Practice Note that permitted the use of representative charges in sexual cases (Practice Note—<emphasis style="italic">Form of indictment—particulars of sexual offending</emphasis> (21 November 1994)).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The second circumstance is new. It is aimed at addressing difficulties that arise for Judges and juries where there are a very large number of charges of the same type (for example, fraud or other dishonesty charges) and the circumstances are such that the defence on 1 charge is likely to be the same for the other charges. Representative charges will be available where there is repetitive or multiple offending in circumstances where particulars are available but the number of charges makes separate charges unmanageable and the verdict on 1 charge is likely to be the same as the verdict on all charges.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Proceeding in the absence of the defendant</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill builds on the current statutory framework and case law to provide a statutory presumption that the court will commence or continue proceedings if the defendant is absent from court without a reasonable excuse. The Bill also enables the court to proceed without the defendant when he or she has a reasonable excuse. In both situations, the court must not proceed without the defendant if it is satisfied that doing so would be contrary to the interests of justice. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>For offences in categories 2, 3, and 4, the court may grant a retrial of a defendant who is found guilty in his or her absence if the court is satisfied that the defendant has a defence that would have had a reasonable prospect of success if he or she had attended the trial. In order for the retrial to be granted, the defendant will need to provide the court with an outline of the defence on which the defendant intends to rely if a retrial is granted and a formal statement from each witness who the defendant intends to call.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Name suppression</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill clarifies and strengthens the law relating to the suppression of names and evidence.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The starting point for considering publication is a presumption of open justice. The Bill identifies a range of interests that may justify suppression, including the risk of prejudice to a fair trial and prejudice to the maintenance of the law. Particular grounds are specified for some situations. For example, publication must cause extreme hardship to the defendant before the court may suppress the defendant’s identity, whereas hardship caused to a victim or witness must only be undue before that person’s identity may be suppressed. The Bill also provides that the fact that a defendant is well known does not, of itself, constitute extreme hardship. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Grounds for closing the court are also specified. However, members of the media as defined in the Bill will generally be able to be present despite the court being closed.</text>

It is anticipated that the Crown will assume direct responsibility for cases earlier in proceedings than currently.

        <para>
          <text>Some rationalisation and consolidation of appeal processes has also occurred. Leave requirements are simplified by providing that leave to appeal must always be obtained from the court appealed to. In addition, consistent time limits for filing an application for leave to appeal or a notice of appeal are established so that, in most cases, an application or notice must be filed within 20 working days of the decision appealed against.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill also gives the Court of Appeal greater flexibility to deal with preliminary matters before an appeal is heard. In particular, leave applications and extensions of time for filing a notice of appeal or an application for leave to appeal will be able to be dealt with by 3 Court of Appeal Judges, with or without a hearing, and without recourse to a bench of 3 or full court. This is similar to the approach that is taken in the Supreme Court (see sections 15, 16, and 27 of the Supreme Court Act 2003).</text>

        <para>
          <text>The High Court and the Supreme Court currently have the ability to dismiss an appeal for procedural non-compliance by the appellant (see section 133(1) of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 and rule 38(4) of the Supreme Court Rules respectively). A recent decision by the Supreme Court, <emphasis style="italic">Petryszick v R</emphasis> [2010] NZSC 105, highlighted that there are no similar powers in either the Crimes Act 1961 or rules of court that can be exercised by the Court of Appeal. As it is not desirable to retain different approaches between the courts in this area, the Bill includes a new provision that enables all appeal courts to treat an appeal as abandoned when the appellant fails to comply with a timetable or other procedural order fixed for the appeal. The appeal court must give the appellant 10 working days’ notice of its intention to treat the appeal as having been abandoned. This provision is intended to balance the caution that should be taken to bringing an appellant’s appeal to an end with the desirability of ensuring that an appellant cannot needlessly delay or frustrate the hearing of an appeal.</text>

          <text>Many provisions in the Bill simply reflect existing provisions in the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 or Crimes Act 1961. The drafting approach taken is generally to consolidate provisions, simplify and modernise language, and ensure that court processes can take advantage of developing information technologies. Only high level procedural requirements are included in the Bill. Matters of detailed procedure will be provided in court rules. This approach preserves minimum standards for the conduct of criminal procedure while ensuring that the legislation is sufficiently flexible to take account of particular circumstances, future technology changes, and other developments.</text>

Currently the common law does allow courts to commence or continue hearings when a defendant is absent provided certain strict criteria are met.

A transfer may be ordered on the court's own motion, or following an application by the prosecutor or the defendant. This clause replaces sections 322 and 326(2) of the Crimes Act 1961.</text>

                <text><emphasis style="italic">Clause 163</emphasis> applies if a charge alleges that a defendant has a previous conviction. The clause requires the defendant to give notice to the prosecutor and the court if he or she disputes that allegation. If no notice is given, the court may take the previous conviction into account as if the defendant had admitted it. If the prosecutor is required to prove the previous conviction, this does not need to be done until the issue of penalty for the offence arises. The clause replaces sections 69AA(1) and (2), and 69A(3) of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957, and section 341(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1961. However, it differs in one significant respect. Under section 69A(3) of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957, the Court is entitled to take the alleged conviction into account only if the defendant is not present before the Court, and has failed to notify the court in writing that he or she disputes the allegation. Under <emphasis style="italic">clause 163</emphasis>, however, the court may take the alleged previous conviction into account whether or not the defendant is present in person, if he or she has not previously given notice that he or she disputes it.</text>

The grounds on which the court may be cleared differ in some respects from the grounds currently set out in section 138(2). In addition, the test for clearing the court is made more stringent than the current test, because a new requirement is added that the court may only be cleared if the court is satisfied that making a suppression order will not be sufficient to avoid the relevant risk. </text>

            <para>
              <text>Every convicted person can appeal against his or her conviction as of right. The rights of appeal are in section 115 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 (for summary cases) and section 383 of the Crimes Act 1961 (for indictable cases). An appeal in a summary case is dealt with in the High Court by way of rehearing. In an indictable appeal, the appeal lies to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court and is disposed of on 1 of the grounds specified in section 385(1) of the Crimes Act 1961. In practice, the different approaches are similar and the appellate courts in each jurisdiction are reluctant to interfere with the trial Judge's findings of fact.</text>

            <para>
              <text>A modified Crimes Act 1961 model is adopted for both Judge-alone trials and jury trials and the Bill sets out the grounds on which the appeal court may determine an appeal. The same principles will apply to all appeals against conviction and the appeal court will determine an appeal by applying an error correction approach. However, in an appeal against a conviction entered in a Judge-alone trial, the rehearing procedure is retained (as in section 119(1) of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957).</text>

            <para>
              <text>All appeals against sentence will be decided on the same principles. Currently, sentence appeals in the summary jurisdiction are dealt with by way of rehearing and the grounds are set out in section 121(3) of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957. Under section 121(3), the High Court may intervene by substituting a new sentence, quashing an invalid part of the sentence, or varying the sentence. By contrast, under section 385(3) of the Crimes Act 1961, the Court of Appeal may intervene if it thinks that a different sentence should have been passed. However, despite the differences in how these tests are expressed in the legislation, the appellate courts in each jurisdiction take a similar approach, looking to see if the sentencing court has fallen into error in applying the sentencing discretion.</text>

                <para>
                  <text>Under the statutory formula in force in New Zealand, the essential question in appeals of this character is whether this Court considers that “a different sentence should have been passed” (see s 385(3)). Those words might support two different interpretations. On a more liberal view it would be open to the Court to consider the sentence in question completely afresh so that if, in the Court’s view, what is an appropriate sentence was different from the sentence appealed from, the Court could re-sentence accordingly. This would involve an unlimited judicial discretion to modify the original sentence. That view, however, has not prevailed. The discretion to vary the sentence is not unfettered; this Court does not embark upon the sentencing afresh nor substitute its own opinion for that of the original sentencer. There must be an error vitiating the exercise of the original sentencing discretion. In short, this Court must proceed on an “error principle”. One of the better explications of this approach is to be found in a decision of the High Court of Australia – <emphasis style="italic">Griffiths v R</emphasis> (1977) 137 CLR 293 at p 308 and following per Barwick CJ. <footnote id="DLM3359944"><para><text><emphasis style="italic">R v Shipton</emphasis> [2007] 2 NZLR 218, 238.</text></para></footnote></text>

The maximum sentence that may be imposed for a contempt remains unchanged (imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months, or a fine not exceeding $1,000 for each offence). The existing Crimes Act 1961 provision differs slightly from the equivalent provision in the Summary Proceedings Act 1957, in that it also covers assaults of, threats to, and intimidation of those involved in the court proceedings. These additional grounds of contempt are not carried forward in <emphasis style="italic">clause 362</emphasis>.</text>
