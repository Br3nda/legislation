          <text>The Bill meets various obligations that are required before New Zealand can accede to the First and Second Protocols to the 1954 Hague Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (the <emphasis style="bold">Convention</emphasis>). Obligations required of New Zealand under the Second Protocol are met in <emphasis style="italic">Part 2</emphasis> of the Bill. This creates a number of criminal offences (for actions against cultural property) that are required by the Protocol, as well as related ancillary offences. Jurisdiction is established over the most serious of these offences so that they can be prosecuted, in certain circumstances, where the offence took place outside New Zealand, or when the offender was not a New Zealander, as required by the Protocol. A penalty regime is established for the offences, and extradition provisions provided for. Obligations required of New Zealand under the First Protocol to the Convention are provided for in <emphasis style="italic">Part 3</emphasis> of the Bill. In this Part, offences are created relating to removal of cultural property from occupied territory, and dealing in such property. The Bill links to powers in the Customs and Excise Act 1996 so as to provide the New Zealand Customs Service with the ability to seize property imported from occupied territory. A regime is provided for assessments of compensation to be made for good faith purchasers of cultural property that may have to be returned to a (previously) occupied territory from which it was taken. It is also desirable to make provision for the protection of the special emblem of the Convention and its Protocols. The Bill does this by establishing an offence of unauthorised use of the emblem. New Zealand ratified the Convention on 24 July 2008.</text>

            <text><emphasis style="italic">Clause 2</emphasis> is the commencement clause. The Bill is to come into force on a date or dates to be appointed by the Governor-General by Order in Council. This is because the Bill cannot be brought into force before New Zealand has acceded to the First and Second Protocols to the Convention. Subject to that, it may be possible for certain provisions of the Bill to be brought into force before others (for example, the offences relating to use of the Convention emblem). <emphasis style="italic">Clause 2</emphasis> therefore provides for different provisions to be brought into force on different dates and for different purposes.</text>

The Convention begins with the premise that damage to the cultural property of any people means damage to the cultural heritage of all people. <emphasis style="italic">Subclauses (2) and (3)</emphasis> list examples of property that might count as cultural property. The definition of cultural property in the Bill is not the same as the definition of protected foreign object in the Protected Objects Act 1975, although some items may fall within both definitions. <emphasis style="italic">Subclause (4)</emphasis> defines the term enhanced protection property. Broadly speaking, it means cultural property included in the list to be maintained by UNESCO under Article 11 of the Second Protocol.</text>

              <text><emphasis style="italic">Clause 7</emphasis> gives effect to Article 15 of the Second Protocol. Article 15 requires parties to the Protocol to establish criminal offences under their domestic law for certain acts that constitute serious violations of the Protocol. These include making cultural property the object of attack and appropriating cultural property. An offence is committed only if the act is intentional and the person either knew or had reason to believe that the property was cultural property (or, where applicable, cultural property under enhanced protection). In addition, the act must occur in a situation of hostilities. This reflects the application of the Second Protocol, as set out in Articles 3 and 22 of the Protocol. An offence is not committed if the person is acting in accordance with the Convention and the Second Protocol, for example if the person is acting by imperative military necessity. Imperative military necessity is explained in Article 6 of the Second Protocol.</text>

              <text><emphasis style="italic">Clause 14</emphasis> is the interpretation clause for <emphasis style="italic">Part 3</emphasis>. It includes a definition of unlawful, which mirrors the definition of illicit in the Second Protocol. Removal of cultural property from an occupied territory is unlawful if it is done under compulsion or otherwise in violation of that territory's laws or of international law (including the Convention and the First and Second Protocols). Another key term is smuggled property. Smuggled property is defined to mean cultural property that has been removed unlawfully from the territory of a First Protocol Party while that territory was occupied by another First Protocol Party. It does not matter when the removal took place provided it took place no earlier than the date when the First Protocol entered into force (7 August 1956). The protections provided by <emphasis style="italic">Part 3</emphasis> of the Bill, therefore, do not extend to property taken from occupied territory before that date. However, they do extend to property taken at any time after that date (for example, property that was taken from occupied territory in the 1970s and kept hidden or traded on the black market after that). If such property is imported into New Zealand after the Bill comes into force, the protections of the Bill will be available to it.</text>

The power of seizure is needed so that New Zealand can comply with its obligation in the First Protocol to take smuggled property into custody. The Customs and Excise Act 1996 also includes a number of ancillary powers to assist with seizure (including powers of entry).
