        <explnote.subhead1>Enhancement of statutory appeal and review rights in relation to forfeiture and seizure regime</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>As a result of the Law Commission’s report <emphasis style="italic">Forfeiture under the Customs and Excise Act 1996</emphasis> (NZLC R91, 2006), Government agreed that enhancements should be made to the forfeiture and seizure regime set down in Part 14 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996.  The regime enables Customs officers to seize certain goods, such as goods associated with offending under the Act and goods that have been unlawfully imported or exported contrary to a range of other enactments. Those parties who wish to reclaim their interest in goods seized as forfeited can apply to either the District Court or the Minister of Customs, or both, depending on the circumstances.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In its report, the Law Commission highlighted concerns with the dual system of appeal to a court and a ministerial review, and stated that it should be possible to challenge the seizure by an initial internal review process, which should involve little or no expense to the challenger and should be able to be accomplished without delay. To give effect to these particular concerns, the appeal avenues contained in the Act, as they relate to forfeiture, are being repealed and replaced with a Customs internal review process. The internal review process will enable applicants to apply to the Chief Executive of Customs for the return of goods seized. Applicants who are dissatisfied with a decision resulting from an internal review will be able to appeal that decision to the Customs Appeal Authority. Customs Appeal Authority decisions will be appealable to the High Court.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Ad hoc arrivals and departures</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>With the exception of compelling circumstances, such as stress of weather or other navigation-related requirements, all craft arriving into and departing from New Zealand are required to do so at a Customs place. In recent years there has been an increase in ad hoc requests for both commercial and recreational purposes for arrivals at and departures from ports and airports that have not been designated as Customs places. The Customs and Excise Act 1996 is to be amended to provide the Chief Executive of Customs with the discretion to approve arrivals and departures outside of Customs places subject to any conditions the Chief Executive considers appropriate, and subject to consultation with other agencies with border-related interests.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Illegal manufacture of tobacco</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The illicit manufacture and supply of tobacco contributes to health, economic, and social harms. For this reason the manufacture of tobacco products in New Zealand is restricted under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 to licensed Customs controlled areas, which facilitates the collection of excise duty on tobacco products. The only exception to this requirement is a personal use exemption that enables the small-scale manufacturing of tobacco leaf into smokable product. To qualify for the exemption, the manufacturing must occur at an individual’s dwelling place, using tobacco grown on his or her own land, and the tobacco products must be exclusively smoked by that individual. However, enforcement activity has highlighted that commercial quantities of tobacco are being cultivated and manufactured with no legitimate end use.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>To address the issue of illegally manufactured tobacco products, the personal use exemption needs to be clarified to assist Customs in identifying cases of illicit tobacco manufacture (while still allowing individuals who wish to cultivate and manufacture a small quantity for their own consumption to do so), and altered to increase penalties to provide a strong disincentive to discourage abuse of the exemption.</text>

        <para>
          <text>This document updates the regulatory impact statement considered by Cabinet in July 2007 when the preliminary scope of proposals submitted at that time, now contained in the attached draft Bill, were considered and agreed to by Cabinet. These proposals, and the further developed detail contained in the Cabinet paper, are intended to enhance appeal and review processes available in relation to forfeiture under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 (the <emphasis style="bold">Act</emphasis>) in a way that improves access to justice without compromising the integrity of the forfeiture regime or of the Act.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This is to be achieved by replacing the 2 currently separate avenues of review and appeal in relation to forfeited goods (ministerial waiver of forfeiture and the ability to apply to the court for disallowance of seizure) with a single two-tiered process comprising at the first stage an internal Customs review process, supported at the second stage by a statutory right of appeal to the Customs Appeal Authority. Decisions of the Customs Appeal Authority will be able to be appealed to the High Court. This option has been selected because an internal review would considerably enhance existing statutory rights and improve access to justice, and would provide a safeguard for the strict nature of the forfeiture regime.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is proposed that there be a single point of entry into the Customs internal review process, and that applicants should apply to the Chief Executive of Customs for a review in the first instance. One point of entry is considered to provide a simpler system and avoids the complexities that a dual system would present, such as issues as to how the 2 systems would interface.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is also proposed that the internal review will be conducted on the papers, unless the review raises issues that could be more effectively dealt with by way of a hearing. It is also proposed that, in considering whether to grant relief, the Chief Executive should have regard to the circumstances of the situation and any other matters that may be relevant to the applicant’s case, such as:</text>

        <para>
          <text>Under the forfeiture regime contained in the Act applicants may make application to the District Court for an order that the seizure of goods (as forfeited to the Crown) be disallowed on the grounds that no reasonable cause for the seizure, or the continued detention of the goods, exists under the Act.

        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Alternative option</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Rather than absorbing the ministerial waiver into the proposed new internal review process, consideration was given to retaining the current ability to apply to the Minister of Customs for waiver of forfeiture. However, the risk of this approach is that it maintains the perception that Ministers could be biased by factors such as the involvement of a local constituent when making a decision to waive. There would also be significant issues to work through in respect of the interface between an internal review (which excluded the ability to waive forfeiture) and the ministerial waiver process, for example, whether the 2 processes would run in parallel or sequentially and how that would work in practice.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In terms of the appeal from decisions arising from the internal review process, consideration was also given to establishing the District Court, rather than the Customs Appeal Authority, as the court to hear appeals from internal review decisions. However, while the District Court has current experience in dealing with forfeiture matters (it hears applications for disallowance of seizure), costs can be higher than the Customs Appeal Authority and therefore discouraging to applicants.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Preferred option</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to replace the 2 currently separate avenues of review and appeal in relation to forfeited goods (ministerial waiver of forfeiture and the ability to apply to the Court for disallowance of seizure) with a single two-tiered process comprising at the first stage an internal Customs review process, supported at the second stage by a statutory right of appeal to the Customs Appeal Authority. This option has been selected because an internal review would considerably enhance existing statutory rights and improve access to justice, and would provide a safeguard for the strict nature of the forfeiture regime.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>While it is recognised that ministerial waiver currently provides a low cost and swift avenue of redress for affected parties, this feature would not be lost if the function were to be absorbed into an internal review process. A single process of internal review that deals with all grounds for review is considered to be an efficient, fair, and expeditious way of considering all challenges to seizure and forfeiture, rather than allowing 2 avenues for challenge that depend on the ground for challenge. It would provide a simplified process for all concerned.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Absorbing the waiver of forfeiture stream into the internal review process would not result in any compliance costs for the public, as it is not intended that a charge be made for applications for internal review. While there is likely to be a cost to the department both in designing and implementing the new process of internal review (estimated at $268,338), this will be absorbed within baseline costs. In terms of dealing with ongoing applications, a considerable portion of the ongoing costs is currently met in reviewing files and writing reports for the Minister in respect of each waiver of forfeiture application.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Any person who wishes to challenge the outcome of the internal review and go to the Customs Appeal Authority is likely to be required to pay an application fee of $400 by reference to the fee currently required in relation to matters dealt with by the Customs Appeal Authority. However, application to the District Court costs $750, with hearing fees for each half-day or part of a half day (after the first half day) of a further $750. The Customs Appeal Authority would provide applicants with a more accessible and cost effective forum for hearing appeals. The Customs Appeal Authority also has the advantage of being able to decide appeals ‘on the papers’ if both parties agree. This would considerably lower the cost to applicants in that there is a one-off fee and legal representation is a matter of choice, and would address any concerns that current court processes can be stressful and intimidating.</text>

        <para>
          <text>It is proposed there should be a single point of entry into the Customs internal review process, whereby applicants should apply to the Chief Executive of Customs, in the first instance, for an internal review. The single entry system has been developed in response to the Law Commission's  view that the existing dual system (under the current Customs forfeiture regime, of challenge to the Minister and/or to the court) is limited and should be abolished in favour of a system that allows an opportunity for first review by the Chief Executive with a right of appeal to an independent body. Also, from an access to justice point of view, one point of entry provides a simpler system and avoids the complexities that a dual system presents (such as how the 2 systems interface).</text>

          <text>Under the current Customs forfeiture regime, a court is able to make an order that the Crown pay an applicant compensation for any depreciation in the value of the goods resulting from their seizure, as well as any related storage or transport costs. It is desirable that an ability to obtain compensation remain; however, because of the shift to an internal review, it is proposed that compensation be dealt with by way of the Chief Executive's  existing financial delegations that allow the Chief Executive to make ex-gratia and compensatory payments in accordance with Cabinet Office Circular CO (99) 7.</text>

In the past Customs has relied on section 25(1)(c) of the Act to authorise such arrivals and departures. However, a recent review of that process by Customs identified doubt about the scope of that provision. This means that people may only depart from and arrive in New Zealand in a limited number of places, which may in some circumstances be unnecessarily restricting.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Preferred option</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to provide the Chief Executive of Customs with the power to approve arrivals and departures at other than Customs places on a case-by-case basis where this is deemed appropriate. Prior to approving an arrival or departure outside of a Customs place the Chief Executive will consult with the chief executives of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the New Zealand Police, the Ministry of Transport, the Department of Labour and every other department of State whose operations may, in the Chief Executive's  opinion, be affected by the action. It is intended that Customs will gazette as many places of arrival and departure as practicable; however, the proposed power is to be used where gazetting as a place of arrival or departure is not appropriate due to the one-off nature of the request being granted. The ability to impose appropriate conditions on those arrivals and departures and to have full Customs powers and authority apply is required.</text>

However, these compliance costs will only apply to those who choose to arrive outside of a Customs place and any costs that will be imposed will only be of a level necessary to allow Customs to complete its tasks. It is expected that if the current provision is not amended the compliance costs for the public will be greater than those incurred by arrival outside a Customs place. This is because the public will have to arrive only at designated Customs places, which could be time consuming and expensive. It is expected that the number of requests where approval may be given to arrive at a place that has not been gazetted as a Customs Port or Airport will be no more than a handful a year.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The current regime for controlling the manufacture of tobacco is contained in the Act. This means it is illegal to manufacture tobacco products outside a licensed Customs controlled area. The personal use exemption contained in regulation 7 of the Customs and Excise Regulations 1996 does however allow persons to manufacture tobacco for their own use without a CCA licence.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Customs has conducted several investigations since 2000 targeting persons in the Golden Bay and Marlborough areas who have been cultivating and manufacturing multi-tonne quantities of tobacco. A number of successful prosecutions of the persons involved have followed these investigations.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The illegal manufacture of tobacco products has undesirable health and social consequences, including making tobacco products available at low cost, which encourages higher consumption levels, with associated health impacts.

        <para>
          <text>Two court cases earlier this year have highlighted an issue with the current offences and penalties.

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There are currently no limits on how much tobacco a person may cultivate. Under the present regime a person may cultivate and possess large quantities of tobacco and tobacco products on his or her property and claim it is all for their personal consumption or not intended for manufacture. The relevant offence only relates to the manufacture of tobacco products outside a CCA.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The main objective of the change being sought is to ensure compliance with the excise regime, which requires the licensing of manufacture of excisable goods.

        <explnote.subhead2>Option 1—Retain status quo</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Retaining the current regime is not considered to be desirable. The numbers of persons thought to be involved in illegal tobacco manufacture and supply are believed to be small, although the quantities involved have been up to several tonnes. One of the features of recent investigations has been the reappearance of certain individuals allegedly involved in illicit manufacture and supply. This indicates that the current law is not providing an adequate disincentive.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The current problem of domestic illicit tobacco cultivation has been the subject of some media coverage, which has highlighted the non-compliance and the small penalties being imposed compared with potential profits. This may encourage others to become involved in illicit manufacture.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Option 2—Banning cultivation of tobacco</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>This is the most radical of the options. However, within New Zealand there are currently only 2 licensed manufacturers who could potentially source some tobacco from New Zealand (both have indicated that they currently source tobacco from offshore). A total ban is therefore unlikely to have a significant economic impact on any future legitimate growers in New Zealand.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A variation of this option would be to ban all commercial growing, but allow individuals to grow small quantities for their personal use similar to the personal use exemption for manufacture. Such a variation could, however, also be abused. Individuals could grow tobacco for friends rather than just themselves, and several small plots could be used to supply tobacco to an illegal manufacturing operation at a central point.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A ban on cultivation would ensure that any cultivation of tobacco could immediately be identified as being illegal. As tobacco plants are difficult to hide, policing could occur while the crop was still in the field. There are unlikely to be any additional enforcement costs associated with a total ban.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This would greatly reduce the level of illegal manufacturing and limit the undesirable fiscal and social consequences of illegal tobacco. A ban would also send a strong signal that Government is concerned about the health and other issues associated with illegal manufacturing and supply.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A total ban could be seen as being a heavy-handed approach given the small number of offenders. Small-scale growers (common in the Golden Bay and Marlborough areas) may view a total ban as an encroachment of personal freedom. In addition, it would remove any future opportunity to legally grow tobacco for economic gain.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Option 3—Introducing licensing regime for cultivation of tobacco</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>A licensing regime to grow tobacco could be developed in addition to the current licensing regime targeting the illicit manufacture of tobacco products. Such a regime would provide authorities with a greater degree of control over cultivation and manufacture. For example, a licence could be conditional on the applicant stating how they intend to use their crop and licences might only be valid for 1 growing season. Alternatively, if licences were valid for a number of years then administrative costs would be lower.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A possible variation could be to provide an exemption from the licence requirement for growing a small amount or area of tobacco for personal use. Such an exemption would reduce Customs’ administrative costs, as well as enforcement costs.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>An exemption for growing tobacco for personal use might be abused through numerous parties separately growing small areas for illegal manufacturing at a central point. However, this risk could be reduced by linking the growing exemption to the personal use exemption for manufacturing, and tightening up on the personal use exemption for manufacturing.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There would be some administrative costs for Customs and compliance costs for those wishing to obtain a licence to grow tobacco (although the number of individuals or organisations affected is likely to be very small). In addition, a licensing regime for tobacco growing might again be considered a heavy-handed approach (although less so than a total ban).</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Preferred option</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to clarify the personal use exemption for manufacture of tobacco by adding more specific criteria to regulation 7. These would include:</text>
          <list>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>that the personal use exemption would only apply to tobacco that is both grown and manufactured on a person's  property.</text>
              </para>
            </item>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>that this exemption would only be related to tobacco for that person's  own personal use and not include sale or supply to anyone else.</text>
              </para>
            </item>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>that it would only be applicable for persons aged 18 and over.</text>
              </para>
            </item>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>in addition it would involve introducing a limit of 8 kilograms of tobacco per person per year. This equates to 31 to 54 roll-your-own cigarettes (at 0.4 to 0.7 grams per cigarette).</text>
              </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This would be accompanied by an increase in the penalties associated for non-compliance with these provisions.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A clarification of the personal use exemption will make it easier to identify and demonstrate that tobacco being cultivated and stored in unlicensed areas is outside the terms of the personal use exemption. This will facilitate enforcement action taken by Customs in respect of illicit manufacture.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A clarified personal use exemption would be seen as a less intrusive measure than licensing or banning tobacco growing and enables backyard growing and manufacture for personal use. It also retains the possibility of legal growing of tobacco for economic gain should commercial circumstances change.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This option does maintain the current situation where in theory unlimited quantities of tobacco may be grown with no legitimate end use. However, this does need to be balanced against the tightening of the personal use exemption criteria and also the deterrence provided by increased penalties.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In view of the fact that this builds on the existing regime and the current absence of any commercial cultivation, this approach is unlikely to create any additional costs associated with administering the licensing regime. It is not expected to involve any additional enforcement costs particularly assuming that the level of non-compliance decreases.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The increase in penalties is consistent with penalties associated with other highly regulated social harms (such as gambling) and provides a more consistent approach across the illicit tobacco supply chain. These penalties also back up the Government's  decision to address this issue with a relatively light-handed regulatory approach by providing the deterrent of increased sanctions for cases of non-compliance.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Implementation and review</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>If Government supports this proposal it can be introduced within a relatively short time frame since it builds on current arrangements. Publicity could be targeted towards the previous growing areas.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Consultation</explnote.ird-crosshead>
