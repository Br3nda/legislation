          <text>Historically, New Zealand has set a high standard for ratification of international human rights treaties and will ratify only when the Government is satisfied that our laws, policies, and practices are not inconsistent with the treaty at issue. Government agencies have assessed that their policies and practice do not present any inconsistency issues but that a number of domestic enactments required amendment before ratification could proceed.</text>

          <para>
            <text>The amendments to other statutes are principally concerned with disqualification from certain public or fiduciary offices. Many statutes provide for automatic disqualification on grounds such as bankruptcy or criminal conviction. Another common ground is where a person is mentally disordered within the meaning  of the Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1993 (the <def-term id="DLM1404005">MHCATA</def-term>), ie, where the person has <quote.in quote="1">an abnormal state of mind ... of such a degree that it poses a serious danger to the health or safety of that person or of others, or seriously diminishes the capacity of that person to take care of himself or herself</quote.in>. These provisions are concerned with automatic disqualification (some statutes also create a power to remove people on other grounds). The amendments in Part 2 of the Bill amend certain statutes either to do away with automatic disqualification for mental disorder, or to replace it with a test based on the exercise of certain powers under the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988 (the <def-term id="DLM1404006">PPPRA</def-term>). Those powers are exercisable where a person lacks the mental capacity to decide a matter (or the ability to communicate decisions). In relation to certain statutes, the amendments also ensure that the exercise of powers under section 30 of the PPPRA (which relates to urgent property orders) does not of itself lead to automatic exclusion from public or fiduciary office.</text>

                    <text>Section 104 specifies the circumstances in which the office of a trustee of a school board automatically becomes vacant. One circumstance is where a property order is made in respect of a trustee under the PPPRA. The amendment relaxes this rule so that, where an urgent order is made under section 30 of the PPPRA, the person is merely suspended from office. An urgent order only lasts for a maximum of 3 months. If the trustee subsequently becomes subject to a final order under section 31 of the PPPRA, the office would become vacant at that point. Otherwise, the suspension would cease when the urgent order lapsed.</text>

The amendment removes the prohibition for people who are subject to an inpatient order or who are special patients under the MHCATA (ie, people who are detained under the MHCATA) and replaces it with a prohibition for people who are subject to a property order under the PPPRA, or subject to a personal order under that Act that reflects adversely on their competence to manage their own affairs. The new prohibitions are intended to make section 171 more consistent with section 103.</text>

In the case of an urgent property order under section 30 of the PPPRA, the council is entitled to suspend the member while the order continues.</text>

The amendment removes the prohibition for those who are mentally disordered within the meaning of the MHCATA and replaces it with a prohibition for those who are subject to a property order under section 30 or 31 of the PPPRA. However, the amendment does not stop a person remaining a member merely because an urgent property order is made in respect of them under section 30 of the PPPRA. Instead, the member is suspended while the order remains in force (see the amendment to section 201). Section 219W prohibits certain people from being elected or holding office as trustees of a community trust established under the 1989 Act. The amendment removes the prohibition for those who are subject to a compulsory treatment order or who are a special patient under the MHCATA. Section 219V(4) treats a trustee who becomes incapable of holding office by virtue of section 219W as having resigned. The amendment to section 219V ensures that a person who becomes subject to an urgent property order is not treated as having resigned but, instead, his office is suspended while the order remains in force.</text>

The amendment removes the prohibition for people who are detained under the MHCATA and replaces it with a prohibition for people who are subject to a property order under section 30 or 31 of the PPPRA. Section 55 provides for the office of a Catchment Board member to become vacant automatically if the member is detained under the MHCATA. The amendment replaces that test with a test based on the member's inability to perform their duties due to disability. Disability is defined by reference to the Human Rights Act 1993.

The amendment removes from the definition a person who is mentally disordered within the meaning of the MHCATA. However, this amendment does not apply to a kai tiaki trust constituted before the Bill comes into force. Section 272 prohibits certain people from being appointed or elected or from holding office as a member of a committee of management of a Maori incorporation. The amendment removes the prohibition for those who are subject to a compulsory treatment order under the MHCATA and replaces it with a prohibition for those who are subject to a personal order or a property order under the PPPRA or for whom a trustee corporation is acting as manager under section 32 or 33 of that Act. However, if an urgent property order is made in respect of a member, the member does not automatically cease to hold office.

          <text>Section 73 of the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001 (the <def-term id="DLM1404009">Act</def-term>) provides that the Minister must, on the introduction into the House of Representatives of a government Bill that proposes an amendment to the Act, bring to the attention of the House the consultation process that was followed in the formulation of the proposed amendment.  The term <emphasis style="bold">Minister</emphasis>, for the purposes of section 73, is defined in section 5 of the Act as the Minister of Finance. </text>

          <text> The Disability (United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) Bill (the <def-term id="DLM1404010">Bill</def-term>) proposes one minor amendment to Part 1 of the Act. It does not propose to amend Part 2, Part 3, Part 4 or any of the schedules of the Act.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill will repeal section 19(6)(b) of the Act. Under section 19, the rate of New Zealand superannuation payable to a patient in a public hospital who has been hospitalised for more than 13 weeks is reduced to the hospital rate. Section 19(6)(b) provides the Ministry of Social Development’s Chief Executive with a discretion to pay a lower rate than the hospital rate having regard to the patient’s capacity to appreciate the payments. This provision is considered to be inconsistent with the rights set out in the Convention. It is also rarely, if ever, used and therefore may be repealed without consequence.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Consultation</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>On 17 April 2008, the Minister for Disability Issues consulted with either the Leader, or the Disability Issues Spokespersons, of ACT New Zealand, the Green Party, the Maori Party, the National Party, New Zealand First, the Progressive Party, and United Future New Zealand, advising them of the government’s intention to table a National Interest Analysis, which proposes New Zealand ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the <def-term id="DLM1404011">Convention</def-term>) and to possibly introduce a Bill to remove minor legislative inconsistencies with the Convention. This consultation did not include specific consideration of the proposed minor amendment to Part 1 of the Act as the relevant inconsistency had not been identified at this time.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Further consultation with parties is unnecessary at this stage as the amendment is technical and has no practical consequence. Neither is consultation with the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation required as the Bill does not amend Part 2 of the Act.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Ministry of Social Development (responsible for administration of Part 1 of the Act), the Ministry of Justice, and the Treasury support the proposed amendment to the Act.</text>
