The proposals are designed to maintain student safety by ensuring that teachers have no contact with students where the teachers are suspected of misconduct that could pose a risk to the students.</text>

          <text>The Complaints Assessment Committee will be able to apply for an interim suspension of a teacher’s practising certificate or authority to teach where an allegation of serious misconduct is being investigated by the Police or by a school board of trustees.</text>

          <text>The initial maximum 3-month suspension of a teacher’s practising certificate or authority to teach will be amended so the suspension can be reviewed after 3 months and extended for further periods of 3 months.

        <explnote.subhead1>Status quo and problem</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Presently, because of different data collection requirements associated with teacher registration and payroll systems, neither the Teachers Council nor the Ministry of Education is able to identify the registration status of a teacher and the name of the school where the teacher is teaching. This means that the Teachers Council cannot identify people who are teaching without a current practising certificate or authorisation, and the Teachers Council has difficulties in contacting registered teachers.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The purpose of Part 10 of the Education Act 1989 is to ensure that only those who have a current practising certificate or authorisation are employed in teaching positions in New Zealand schools and early childhood education services. The reason for allowing only registered or authorised teachers in New Zealand classrooms is to ensure that the learning environment is safe and that it maximises students’ learning. In effect, the purpose of registration fails where non-registration is ignored.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Teachers Council has had difficulty trying to contact registered teachers, because some teachers move without notifying the Teachers Council of their new postal address. The Teachers Council needs to do this for the following reasons:</text>

                <text>to gain and maintain full registration requires a teaching service requirement. If this was being updated regularly through information-matching, it would reduce a number of queries to registration applicants. Those queries delay processing and can be costly.</text>

          <text>The Ministry of Education also needs to identify which teachers are registered to honour collective agreement allowances. This currently involves time-consuming and costly manual identification processes.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Identifying schools that are employing teachers without a current practising certificate or authorisation could be achieved by asking the Privacy Commissioner to issue a Code of Practice. Identifying teachers’ registration status by school concerns individuals’ livelihoods, which means this matter is better dealt with through primary legislation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In 2005, the Ministry of Education asked schools to provide the registration numbers of teachers on the payroll so it could set up a database to determine teachers’ eligibility for collective agreement allowances. Poor levels and degrees of compliance resulted in inaccurate data. This experience, combined with government policy to minimise compliance costs for schools, means that this is not a preferred option.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Preferred option</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>An authorised information-matching programme would allow the Teachers Council to identify schools employing teachers who do not hold a current practising certificate or authorisation. The programme would also allow the Ministry of Education to streamline its presently inefficient method of determining a teacher’s registration status and correctly pay those allowances that are dependent on such status.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The information-matching programme carries no compliance costs for schools or teachers.

          <text>Concerns have been raised by members of the schooling and ECE sectors, by contractors employed in both sectors, and by commentators such as the Children’s Commissioner about several aspects of the current system.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>First, there are safety concerns. A window of 2 weeks is provided for the Police vetting of non-permanent staff and of contractors who regularly work in a school or ECE service. This creates a safety risk in the intervening period before a Police vet is obtained. By using regularity as the relevant threshold, rather than unsupervised access (in the case of contractors), it also overlooks the potential for a safety risk to arise through even occasional or one-off access to children.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There are also compliance concerns for schools, ECE services and contractors (which are generally small- to medium-sized businesses)—</text>

              <para>
                <text>schools and ECE services are required to use the Teachers Council as the conduit for Police vetting of non-teaching staff and contractors. The Teachers Council charges a $10 fee per Police vet, whereas this service is currently provided free of charge by the Police. Originally, the $10 fee covered the Teachers Council administration costs. In practice, this fee has not covered the full cost, meaning that teaching registration fees are subsidising the service provided by the Teachers Council. The Teachers Council annual budget includes $15,000 to $30,000 to cover the shortfall:</text>

              <para>
                <text>all contractors who regularly work in a school or ECE service during operating hours are required to undergo a Police vet, even though many would never have unsupervised access to children. This creates needless compliance costs for the schools and ECE services that employ these contractors. This is exacerbated by the lack of any definition in the Act for <quote.in quote="1">regularly</quote.in>, which results in inconsistent and excessive Police vetting:</text>

              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>there is no allowance in the Act for the recording or sharing of Police vetting information between schools and ECE services. This means that contractors who work within multiple schools and/or ECE services are required to complete a new Police vet for every school or ECE service, creating excessive compliance costs for all affected parties.</text>

          <text>The status quo entails a low cost for the Crown but a high cost for schools, ECE services, contractors, the Teachers Council and the Police. The status quo also creates a potentially high risk for some children because of its failure to provide adequate safeguards.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Alternative options</explnote.subhead1>
        <explnote.subhead2>Non-regulatory option 1: information campaign and centralised register</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>An information campaign could be used to improve safety by highlighting the importance of Police vetting for all staff who have unsupervised access to children. The campaign could also reduce needless compliance by providing a clear, consistent message about what constitutes regular work (as it applies to contractors) under the Act.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In conjunction with this, the development of a centralised system for the copying and retention of completed Police vets could assist in eliminating duplicate vetting. The apparent advantage of this approach would be eroded, however, through the increase in price that would be needed to cover the additional administrative costs that this option would create for the Teachers Council. In this way, the option would merely replace existing compliance costs for schools and ECE services with new compliance costs.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Non-regulatory option 2: development of Police vetting confirmation card</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>We have also considered the development of a Police vetting confirmation card, which could confirm that an individual had successfully completed a Police vet and allow for employment across the education sector. This could be renewable on a three-yearly basis.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This system already operates in a number of other countries and would address safety concerns caused through delays in obtaining Police vets. It would also reduce the compliance costs associated with duplicate vetting requirements. This option would not, however, address all safety and compliance concerns.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It would not prevent unsupervised access to children and would do nothing to encourage schools to develop a risk management process—indeed, reliance on a card as a proxy for <quote.in quote="1">safety</quote.in> may encourage complacency in this area. This option would also introduce a new safety concern through the inherent risk of card fraud.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This option would also introduce new costs for schools and ECE services. Initial investigations suggest that the per-card cost may be $45, once all production and processing costs are taken into account. This cost is not likely to be offset through the reduction in the number of Police vets most schools and ECE services would be required to obtain.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Regulatory option 1: only Police vet non-teaching staff who have unsupervised access to children and young people</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Only vetting non-teaching staff who have unsupervised access to children and young people would reduce the number of Police vets required but may raise issues of practicality. To ensure the safety of children, ECE services and schools will have to manage and monitor more closely, often on a daily basis, who has unsupervised access to children to ensure that non-teaching staff without a vet never have unsupervised access.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Regulatory option 2: removing current Police vetting requirements for contractors and their employees</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Removing the current requirement to Police vet contractors would not remove the responsibility that ECE services and schools have to ensure the safety of children and young people. Regulation 56 of the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 requires ECE service providers to exclude someone from having any contact with children if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the person poses a risk. School boards are required to provide a safe environment as part of the National Administration Guidelines. Requiring only contractors who have unsupervised access to children to be Police vetted is, however, the preferred option to ensure a consistent risk response to safety concerns.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Adequacy statement</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>This regulatory impact statement has been reviewed by the Ministries of Social Development and Education. It has been assessed as being adequate according to the objectives defined by Cabinet (Cabinet Office Circular CO (07) 3 refers, dated 3 April 2007).</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Status quo and problem</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Section 307 of the Education Act 1989 requires recipients and third parties to supply specific information related to student allowance and loan entitlement.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Currently, it is not an offence for a student to knowingly make a false declaration in an application for a student allowance or student loan or in a change in circumstances notification. The offence provisions only relate to making false or misleading statements, or providing false or misleading documents, in response to a requirement to provide information or particulars or in questioning during an investigation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This distinction between the types of misleading statements or failure to provide legally required information means that, at times, StudyLink is unable to collect full and accurate information to establish full and correct entitlement to student allowances and loans.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>If a student allowance and loan recipient refuses to provide papers, documents, information and particulars, or answer questions during an investigation, StudyLink can suspend a student allowance (but not a loan), or may refuse to grant a student allowance or a student loan. This provision is useful when a student or their parent fails to provide information or answer questions relevant to a student’s entitlement.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The above power, however, is insufficient if StudyLink needs information from a third party or if it has some evidence that past entitlement has been based on inaccurate information and thus it should be seeking to establish and recover overpayments. Suspending or refusing to grant an allowance is unlikely to impact on a third party who has refused to answer statutorily authorised questions from StudyLink about a particular recipient’s entitlement. Similarly, the power to suspend a student’s allowance may be an ineffective sanction, if the student judges that the historical overpayments are higher than any future payments might be (in particular, when the recipient is no longer receiving a student allowance or loan).</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Objectives</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Appropriate offence provisions are necessary to ensure that StudyLink has the right information to calculate correct student allowance and loan entitlements. Offence provisions act as a deterrent as well as a punishment for an offence. The objective of these proposals is to further the above by correcting obvious gaps in the current legislation and helping to ensure that where overpayments have been made, these can be established and recovered.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Alternative options</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Utilising the offence provisions under the Crimes Act 1961 for students making fraudulent or misleading statements is not generally appropriate because—</text>

            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>the maximum penalties for making fraudulent statements under the Crimes Act 1961 are significantly higher (3 years imprisonment under section 111 and 7 years under section 241) than the maximum penalty under the Education Act 1989 (12 months imprisonment) for a similar offence. Potentially this could also lead to a student who provides false information receiving a significantly higher penalty than a beneficiary committing a similar offence and being penalised under the Social Security Act 1964 (maximum penalty 12 months imprisonment). This raises serious issues about proportionality:</text>

              <para>
                <text>a 12 months penalty is likely to provide a sufficient deterrent against most such offending:</text>

              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>given that offence provisions already exist under the Education Act 1989, it makes sense to ensure that they are comprehensive and gaps in the legislation are plugged.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In relation to the refusal to provide relevant information, there are no viable alternatives that have been considered beyond adopting the enhanced offence provisions or retaining the inadequate status quo.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There could be some alternative amounts considered in substitution for the proposed offence penalty, ie, $2,000 or $5,000. These proposed amounts, however, mirror existing penalties in the Education Act 1989, and similar offence provisions in the Social Security Act 1964, and there is no good reason for suggesting a departure from these sanctions. </text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Preferred option</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to expand current offence provisions to plug the gaps that currently exist in the Education Act 1989 and to make the proposed sanctions consistent with similar provisions in other legislation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Current compliance by recipients and third parties with requirements to provide information relating to student allowance and loan entitlement is already high. As with current offence provisions, it is envisaged that use of the proposed expansion of offence provisions would be limited, but is nevertheless required, both as a deterrent and punishment for those who may provide false information or refuse to provide information required to assess student allowance or loan entitlement. StudyLink refers approximately 80 cases annually to the Benefit Control Unit for consideration of prosecution, with resulting prosecutions totalling less than 30 a year. It is not expected that the proposed changes will lead to a significant increase in prosecutions over and above this number.</text>
        </para>

          <text>There are unlikely to be any additional compliance costs for business or for the general public arising from the proposals.</text>

          <text>Section 307AA(2) of the Education Act 1989 provides for a maximum penalty of up to 12 months imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $5,000 if a recipient of a student allowance or student loan knowingly fails to notify a change in circumstances, for the purpose of receiving or continuing to receive a payment to which they are not entitled.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The proposal will expand the coverage of section 307AA(2) so that a student allowance or student loan applicant (or recipient), who knowingly makes a false or misleading statement in an application, or in a notification of a change of circumstances, for the purpose of receiving or continuing to receive a payment to which they are not entitled, commits an offence and is liable to the same penalty referred to in the previous paragraph.</text>
        </para>

        <para>

        <para>
          <text>As noted above, the proposed amendments will complement existing information-gathering powers in the Education Act 1989 by filling legislative gaps that currently exist in the offence provisions in respect of those various requirements.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Implementation and review</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>StudyLink will not need to make any changes to existing publications as the proposed changes only bolster existing powers by providing effective sanctions. StudyLink will advise major stakeholders of the proposed changes at its regular stakeholder meetings, once Cabinet approval has been received. These meetings will include student unions, as well as tertiary institutions.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>As with current offence provisions, it is envisaged that use of the proposed, expanded offence provisions would be limited. StudyLink refers approximately 80 cases annually to the Benefit Control Unit for consideration of prosecution, resulting in fewer than 30 prosecutions a year. It is not expected that the proposed changes will lead to a significant increase in prosecutions over and above this number.</text>

          <text>The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Development (including StudyLink) have been involved in the preparation of this regulatory impact statement. In addition, the Ministry of Justice, Housing New Zealand Corporation and the Department of Corrections have been consulted and have raised no objections. The Tertiary Education Commission has been informed of the proposals.</text>
