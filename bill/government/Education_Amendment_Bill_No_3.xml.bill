        <para>
          <text>This Bill amends the Education Act 1989. The Bill has 2 broad areas of policy focus: to enhance student safety in both the early childhood and compulsory sectors; and improve accountability for student attendance and engagement in the compulsory sector. There are minor policy changes designed to enhance the efficient governance of the compulsory education system and to enhance the efficient administration of the compulsory and tertiary education systems. There are changes to existing provisions to clarify some definitions and correct minor technical and drafting errors in the Act. These changes will help to modernise and improve education legislation.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Police vetting changes</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill proposes amendments designed to: minimise the risk that some non-teaching staff, contractors and volunteers may have unsupervised access to children without being police-vetted; reduce the compliance costs associated with obtaining police vets; and minimise needless police vetting.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The changes will require the police vetting of only those non-teaching staff, contractors and volunteers, who have, or are likely to have, unsupervised access to children during opening hours. The police vet must be obtained before the person concerned has unsupervised access to children. School management or boards, and early childhood education services, will no longer be strictly required to police vet non-teaching staff, contractors and volunteers who do not have unsupervised access to children.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill proposes that the New Zealand Teachers Council ceases to provide a police vetting service to early childhood education services and schools, and services and schools apply directly to the New Zealand Police to obtain police vets.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Minister of Education is empowered to specify particular agencies which have police vetting processes for their employees who work within multiple schools or early childhood education services. The employees of these agencies will not have to be police-vetted again by the early childhood service(s) or school(s) concerned.</text>

          <text>The Bill proposes amendments to allow for an authorised information matching system to: assist the Teachers Council to ensure that only registered teachers holding current practising certificates or persons authorised by the Council to teach, are employed in teaching positions; and to enable the Ministry of Education to keep accurate registration information about teachers who are entitled to registration-dependent allowances.</text>
        </para>

        <explnote.subhead1>Minor procedural changes to teacher complaints and disciplinary processes</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill proposes 2 minor procedural changes to the current processes of the 2 independent disciplinary bodies, the Complaints Assessment Committee and the Disciplinary Tribunal, overseen by the New Zealand Teachers Council. The proposals are designed to maintain student safety by ensuring that teachers have no contact with students where they are suspected of misconduct that could pose a risk to the students.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Complaints Assessment Committee will be able to apply for an interim suspension of a teacher’s practising certificate or authority to teach, where an allegation of serious misconduct is being investigated by the police or by a school board of trustees.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The initial maximum 3 month suspension of a teacher’s practising certificate or authority to teach will be amended so the suspension can be reviewed after 3 months and extended for further periods of 3 months. Affected teachers will be able to make representations at each 3-monthly review.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A further amendment will remove a procedural inconsistency in the assessment of teacher impairment so it becomes a discretionary activity for cases involving both teacher incompetence and teacher misconduct.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The Bill proposes grouping together in a new section of the Act the current key responsibilities of a school board. This is designed to create a distinct section that parallels the approach taken with legislation for other Crown entities. The amendment will express the responsibilities of school boards as required functions, discretionary functions and authorised functions that require the approval of the Minister of Education. The Minister may approve classes of authorised functions (with any conditions considered necessary or desirable) that all boards may undertake without further approval. Board failure, or refusal, to fulfil the required functions of boards of trustees, or to follow conditions attached to an authorised function, are added as grounds for an intervention action.</text>

In effect, the purpose of registration fails where non-registration is ignored.</text>

                <text>the statutory role of the New Zealand Teachers Council in facilitating police vets is subsidised by user schools and ECE services, which incur a $10 fee per police vet.

        <para>
          <text>In conjunction with this, the development of a centralised system for the copying and retention of completed police vets could assist in eliminating duplicate vetting. The apparent advantage of this approach would be eroded, however, through the increase in price that would be needed to cover the additional administrative costs that this option would create for the New Zealand Teachers Council. In this way, the option would merely replace existing compliance costs for schools and ECE services with new compliance costs.</text>

        <para>

        <para>
          <text>This system already operates in a number of other countries and would address safety concerns caused through delays in obtaining police vets.

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It would not prevent unsupervised access to children and would do nothing to encourage schools to develop a risk management process—indeed, reliance on a card as a proxy for <quote.in quote="1">safety</quote.in> may encourage complacency in this area.

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This option would also introduce new costs for schools and ECE services. Initial investigations suggest that the per-card cost may be $45, once all production and processing costs are taken into account.

        <para>
          <text>New Zealand currently has very low rates of engagement in schooling: truancy rates continue to rise and retention in schooling until age 16 remains low compared to other OECD member countries. While the legislative settings for school attendance are unlikely to drive engagement, they do influence the way that this may occur and may currently limit engagement in a number of ways. Changes to New Zealand’s school attendance legislation could signal, at the highest level, the possibilities for increasing student engagement in education.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Status quo and problem</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Most New Zealand students stay at school until at least the age of 16 and more are leaving school with qualifications than ever before, but it is clear that not all young people are engaged in learning. Retention in schooling until age 16 is lower today than in 1993, the year in which the school-leaving age was raised from 15 to 16, and is low by international comparisons. The number of students who are truant from school also continues to increase: approximately 24, 223 students were truant from school on any given day in 2004; in 2006, this number had risen to 29, 470. There is also a noticeable spike in truancy rates at the transition point from primary to secondary schooling—from 2.09% to 5.34%—revealing a general decline in engagement at this point. Combined, these statistics suggest that urgent action is needed to find new ways to engage all students in education; and particularly secondary-aged students.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>While attendance is not the same as engagement, it is a prerequisite. Currently some of the provisions for school attendance in the Education Act 1989 (the <emphasis style="bold">Act</emphasis>) may limit engagement by providing only limited accountability for ensuring that student attendance occurs.</text>

          <text>An information campaign could be used to promulgate best practice advice, highlighting the effective practices that schools have already developed to ensure student attendance.

        <explnote.subhead2>Non-regulatory approach: develop funding incentives to encourage attendance</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Tying schools’ public funding to student retention could provide a powerful incentive to boost student engagement in learning. Under this model, the funding would follow the student and where a student leaves school, the school would lose the funding. This approach is likely, however, to create significant negative externalities, as it may have the effect of penalising schools for student behaviour that is beyond their control. The <quote.in quote="1">punitive</quote.in> effect of this approach is likely to impact on low-decile schools, in particular, which are disproportionately affected by truancy and early drop-out, and may compromise their viability. The costs of this approach are therefore likely to outweigh its possible benefits.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The amendments seek to build on existing effective practice in schools and should overlap with this in most cases. For some schools, however, there will be new compliance costs associated with the requirements to take minimum steps to ensure attendance. These minimum steps will require schools to undertake new activities in some cases, including more detailed monitoring of attendance, more regular communication with parents and more routine interventions where absence is unjustified or unexplained. Of these activities, the requirement to contact parents on the first day that unexplained or unjustified absence is identified is likely to impose the greatest cost for schools.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The majority (at least 78%) of all schools already contact parents on the first day that unexplained or unjustified absence is identified, and only 10% wait 2 or more days to contact parents.<footnote id="DLM1594210"><para><text>This is based on the results of the questionnaire on school attendance practices, circulated with the 2004 national attendance and absence survey. Question 3 of this questionnaire asked, <quote.in quote="1">Generally, how soon are parent(s) informed if a student is found to be absent?</quote.in> A total of 2147 schools responded to this question (80% of all state and integrated schools). Of these, 1669 (or 78%) stated that they responded on the first day, 224 (10%) waited 2 or more days and 254 (12%) provided an invalid response.</text></para></footnote> This latter group of schools is most likely to comprise mid-decile full primary schools.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The total annual per-school cost to be $7,066 for those primary schools that already contact parents on the first day an absence is identified.<footnote id="DLM1594211"><para><text>This figure is based on annual business transaction costs of $3,940 plus annual salary costs of $3,126. The business transaction costs assume that each full primary school will make an average of 13.8 calls per day (based on the 2006 average absence rate for primary schools of 9.1% “converted” into 15 534 primary-aged students absent on any given day and spread between all 1 118 primary schools). The cost is based on Telecom’s flat charge for business customers of 4.5c (plus GST) per phone call per minute and an assumption that the average call will last 3 minutes. The annual salary costs assume a total of 1 hour’s work per day, remunerated at the median hourly rate for school secretaries (based on the 2007 School Support Staff collective agreement). If we assume that, for some schools, up to half of the parents will not have phone connections, the associated postal costs (at 50c per contact) will reduce the overall annual cost to $5,746.</text></para></footnote> This will represent a new cost for the 10% of primary schools that do not currently follow this practice. Correspondingly, however, the new requirement is likely to decrease the average truancy rates of the affected schools from 5.7% to an estimated 1.8%—resulting, in absolute terms, in an extra 5 100 students regularly attending school.<footnote id="DLM1594212"><para><text>This is based on a comparative analysis of the 2004 truancy rates of those schools that already contact parents on the first day an absence is identified relative to those that wait 2 or more days to contact parents.</text></para></footnote> So over time the cost per school would decrease. There will also be benefits for students and parents through enhanced student safety—particularly at the primary school level. While we cannot quantify these benefits, we expect them to be significant.</text>

          <text>Removing early leaving exemptions is likely to reduce the number of students enrolling with education providers who cater for students under the age of 16.

        <para>
          <text>Since 2007 there has been a significant reduction in applications for exemptions as a result of the Ministry of Education tightening up on the criteria and application process and schools taking greater responsibility for meeting the needs of their students.

          <text>Section 307AA(2) of the Act provides for a maximum penalty of up to 12 months imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $5,000 if a recipient of a student allowance or student loan knowingly fails to notify a change in circumstances, for the purpose of receiving or continuing to receive a payment to which they are not entitled.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Legal advice is that it is not an offence under section 307AA(1) or section 307AA(2) for a student to knowingly make a false declaration in an application for a student allowance or student loan or in a change in circumstances notification, as these provisions are overly narrow. Section 307AA(1) is only likely to apply in respect of students who make false or misleading statements, or provide false or misleading documents, in response to a requirement to provide information or particulars or in questioning during an investigation. Section 307AA(2) appears to only apply to students who fail to provide any particulars at all.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The current offence provisions then are insufficient with no apparent justification for the distinction between those types of misleading statements or failure to provide legally required information for which prosecution is provided for, and those for which it is not.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Refusal to provide relevant information</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Section 307(3) of the Act provides that recipients of student allowance and loans may be required to provide papers, documents, etc and information and particulars, and section 307(4) for investigations of recipients’ circumstances. Section 307(5) provides that a person (whether or not a recipient) who is asked questions, during an investigation, under section 307(4) must answer those questions.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>If a person refuses to comply with section 307(3) or answer questions under section 307(5), the Ministry can, under section 307(6), suspend a student allowance (but not a loan), or may refuse to grant a student allowance or a student loan. This provision is useful when a student or their parent fails to provide information or answer questions relevant to a student’s entitlement.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The above power, however, is insufficient if the Ministry needs information from a third party or it has some evidence that past entitlement has been based on inaccurate information and thus it should be seeking to establish and recover overpayments. Suspending or refusing to grant an allowance is unlikely to impact on a third party who has refused to answer statutorily authorised questions from the Ministry about a particular recipient’s entitlement. Similarly, the power to suspend a student’s allowance may be an ineffective sanction, if the student judges that the historical overpayments are higher than any future payments might be (in particular, when the recipient is no longer receiving a student allowance or loan).</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Objectives</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Appropriate offence provisions are necessary to better ensure that the Ministry has the right information to calculate correct student allowance and loan entitlements. Offence provisions act as a deterrent as well as a punishment for an offence. The objective of these proposals is to further the above by correcting obvious gaps in the current legislation and helping to ensure that where overpayments have been made, overpayments are better enable to be established and recovered.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Alternative options</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>While there exists the option of utilising the offence provisions under the Crimes Act 1961 for students making fraudulent or misleading statements, this option is not generally appropriate because—</text>
          <list>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>the maximum penalties for making fraudulent statements under the Crimes Act 1961 are significantly higher (3 years imprisonment under section 111 and 7 years under section 114) than the maximum penalty under the Education Act 1989 (12 months imprisonment) for a similar offence. Potentially this could also lead to a student providing false information receiving a significantly higher penalty than a beneficiary committing a similar offence and being penalised under the Social Security Act 1964 (maximum penalty 12 months imprisonment). This raises serious issues about proportionality:</text>

              <para>
                <text>a 12 months penalty is likely to provide a sufficient deterrent against most such offending:</text>

            </item>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>given that offence provisions already exist under the Education Act 1989, it makes sense to ensure that they are comprehensive and gaps in the legislation are plugged.</text>

            </item>
          </list>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In relation to the refusal to provide relevant information, there are no viable alternatives that have been considered beyond adopting the enhanced offence provisions or retaining the inadequate status quo.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There could be some alternative amounts considered in substitution for the proposed offence penalty, ie, $2,000 or $5,000. These proposed amounts, however, mirror existing penalties in the Act, and similar offence provisions in the Social Security Act 1964, and there is no good reason for suggesting a departure from these sanctions.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Preferred option</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to expand current offence provisions to plug the gaps that currently exist in the Act and to make the proposed sanctions consistent with similar provisions in other legislation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Current compliance by recipients and third parties with requirements to provide information relating to student allowance and loan entitlement is already high. As with current offence provisions, it is envisaged that use of the proposed expansion of offence provisions would be limited, but are nevertheless required, both as a deterrent and to provide for punishment for those who may provide false information or refuse to provide information required to assess student allowance or loan entitlement. StudyLink refers approximately 80 cases annually to the Benefit Control Unit for consideration of prosecution, with resulting prosecutions totalling less than 30 a year. It is not expected that the proposed changes will lead to a significant increase in prosecutions over and above this number.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There are unlikely to be any additional compliance costs for business or for the general public arising from the proposals. Only those that do not supply information already legally required to assess student allowance and loans entitlement will be affected by the proposed expansion of offence provisions.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Section 307AA(2) of the Act provides for a maximum penalty of up to 12 months imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $5,000 if a recipient of a student allowance or student loan knowingly fails to notify a change in circumstances, for the purpose of receiving or continuing to receive a payment to which they are not entitled.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The proposal will expand the coverage of section 307AA(2) so that a student allowance or student loan applicant (or recipient), who knowingly makes a false or misleading statement in an application, or in a notification of a change of circumstances, for the purpose of receiving or continuing to receive a payment to which they are not entitled, commits an offence and is liable to the same penalty referred to in the previous paragraph.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This proposal would make section 307AA(2) more consistent with section 127 of the Social Security Act 1964.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Ministry (StudyLink) will not need to make any changes to existing publications as the proposed changes do not affect existing powers but rather bolster existing powers by providing effective sanctions. StudyLink is planning to advise major stakeholders of the proposed changes at its regular stakeholder meetings, once Cabinet agreement has been gained. These meetings will include student unions, as well as tertiary institutions.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>As with current offence provisions, it is envisaged that use of the proposed, expanded offence provisions would be limited.
