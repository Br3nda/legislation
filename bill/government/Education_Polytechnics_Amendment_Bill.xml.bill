          <text>The polytechnic sector faces particular educational and financial challenges, which are likely to be exacerbated by an increasingly constrained funding environment. The public policy objectives of this Bill are—</text>

        <para>
          <text>The Bill addresses the first objective by introducing new governance arrangements for polytechnics. The aim is to build the capability of polytechnic councils for decisive and responsive decision-making by—</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill reflects aspects of the unique context within which polytechnic councils operate, by retaining, and in some instances strengthening, the representative nature of councils.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The emphasis on improved governance is reinforced by the introduction of new individual duties to be placed on polytechnic council members, which reflect those set out in the Crown Entities Act 2004. Particular emphasis is placed upon the primary responsibility of a council member to serve the interests of the institution. The new duties, when combined with the collective duties already specified in the Education Act 1989, will provide greater clarity and certainty regarding the expectations on and responsibilities of council members.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In order to assist with the recruitment of suitable candidates for council membership, especially in rural areas, the Bill introduces measures to facilitate collaborative governance arrangements. As an example, the Bill clarifies that individuals can sit on more than 1 polytechnic council.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.crosshead>The interventions framework</explnote.crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill addresses the second objective by amending the Education Act 1989 to create a more flexible interventions framework for the polytechnic sector; one which allows for a gradually escalating series of responses to situations of risk. The current interventions framework is insufficiently graduated to enable the Crown to intervene appropriately where a polytechnic is at risk (either because of educational or financial performance issues) and in a manner commensurate with the level of risk.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.crosshead>Miscellaneous amendments</explnote.crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>At present, each individual polytechnic has an academic board. The Bill provides for 2 or more polytechnic councils and combined councils to establish a combined academic board. It is intended that this will facilitate collaboration between polytechnics, and improve administrative efficiency.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill modifies the application of certain provisions of the Education Act 1989 so as to enable the Manukau Institute of Technology to establish a tertiary education high school. This is a trial project, which is aimed at reducing the numbers of young people leaving school without adequate qualifications. Eligible students in years 11–13 will be transitioned towards achieving a tertiary qualification.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Also, minor technical amendments are made to the tertiary education Parts of the Education Act 1989, with the aim of updating the Act through removal of redundant provisions.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The polytechnic sector faces financial and educational performance problems that are likely to be exacerbated by an increasingly constrained funding environment. These problems often arise from or are worsened by ineffective governance, and the statutory intervention framework for polytechnics does not allow the Crown to readily address issues as they arise. The result is that polytechnics pose a relatively high risk to the Crown.</text>

        <para>
          <text>To reduce this risk, the Government intends to amend the governance arrangements and the intervention framework for polytechnics in the Education Act 1989.

          <text>The large size of these councils, and the emphasis of their composition on representativeness over and above governance skill and experience, has resulted in ineffective governance at some institutions.

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>These governance issues have contributed to the financial and educational performance problems faced by polytechnics: in recent years, a number of polytechnics have required Crown interventions, and in some cases Crown loans have been used to maintain their viability.

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The first 2 interventions involve suggestion or persuasion, and the third step involves drastic direct action. There is no middle ground whereby the Crown can require a council to change its behaviour in specific respects without going to the extreme of dissolving it entirely. The Government has needed to use all 3 of these interventions in polytechnics in recent years (in some cases repeatedly), including the appointment of a Crown commissioner. It has not used the interventions in universities.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Governance arrangements</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>In developing this legislation the Government did not consider making fundamental changes to polytechnic governance models. This is because there is some urgency in making these changes, and far-reaching change would require analysis and consultation that could not be undertaken sufficiently quickly. It also did not seriously consider enlarging councils, as evidence from the private sector, along with anecdotal feedback from board and council members in New Zealand, suggests that smaller governing bodies are generally more effective than large ones.<footnote id="DLM2294207"><para><text>For example, see Huther, J.

              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>Option 2: Removing these representatives entirely, along with employer/employee and professional body representatives, leaving only the ministerial appointments and chief executive:</text>
              </para>
            </item>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>Option 3: Requiring the Minister for Tertiary Education to appoint all council members (with smaller councils).</text>
              </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The latter 2 options were rejected as being inconsistent with the conception of tertiary education institutions as partnerships between the Crown and communities. This partnership ethos is fundamental to all tertiary education institutions and is reflected in the way that key stakeholders are represented on these institutions’ governing bodies.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The first option was considered to be unbalanced in the opposite direction, with too much emphasis on representation and too little on governance capability. It would see councils comprise ten or eleven members: four ministerial appointments, the chief executive, an academic staff representative, a general staff representative, a student representative, an employer body representative, an employee body representative, and (if applicable) a professional body representative. Of these, only the four ministerial appointments would have to be appointed on the basis of their governance skill; suitably experienced candidates might be reluctant to accept appointments in these circumstances. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>With respect to multi-institutional councils (see <quote.in quote="1">Preferred option</quote.in> below), the Government also considered providing for multi-institutional councils that would consider the interests of the polytechnics over which they governed collectively. This would mean that the interests of one institution could be traded off against the interests of another. This option raised substantive policy issues that were unable to be addressed in the Bill’s timeframe, and so has been included in the ongoing polytechnic policy work programme.</text>

        <para>
          <text>For the sake of brevity and clarity, the multiple alternative options below are presented as broad policy choices.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Choice 1: More/fewer interventions </explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The core problem with the current intervention framework is its lack of graduated steps, and so in considering alternatives the Government concentrated on adding interventions rather than removing them.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>As a starting point it considered the more graduated set of interventions that already exists in the compulsory schooling sector, as set out in Part 7A of the Education Act 1989. For each of these interventions not already mirrored in the tertiary framework, the Government assessed whether there was value in including a similar provision for polytechnics. In each case, it was decided that this was indeed valuable, because the more interventions the Crown has to choose from, the better it can tailor its response to an institution at risk.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This created a six-step framework, which was felt to be adequately sensitive to different levels of risk. The Government considered that incorporating interventions beyond these six would have added administrative complexity without adding value.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Choice 2: Administration of interventions</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Government had to choose whether to vest the new powers of intervention with the Minister for Tertiary Education or with the chief executive of the TEC. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Government ultimately considered that interventions up to and including the requirement to carry out a remedial plan (see below) should rest with the chief executive of the TEC. This is because these interventions fit naturally alongside the TEC’s existing monitoring role and happen <quote.in quote="1">at arm’s length</quote.in> from the institution.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The tertiary high school is to be established to trial a new concept.

        <para>
          <text>Current legislation contains barriers to these arrangements. It requires students under the age of 16 to be enrolled at and attending a school. The MIT proposal is that students are enrolled at and attending the tertiary high school full-time from the beginning of Year 11. Many students at this time will not yet be 16.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Under the Education Act 1989, a board of trustees retains ultimate responsibility for its students even when they are undertaking off-site courses. The students at the MIT tertiary high school will spend their working day in the tertiary environment. In these circumstances the board of trustees of the school where they are also enrolled will have very little ability to exercise their statutory responsibility for the students.</text>

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Objective</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>New Zealand has too many young people who leave school without worthwhile qualifications. The Government would like to trial a tertiary high school as one way to reverse this trend and support students to staircase into obtaining tertiary qualifications. The objective of this amendment is to allow the trial to begin at the beginning of 2010.</text>

        <para>
          <text>One option considered was to enrol only those Year 11 students who had turned 16 by the beginning of 2010. Most students are still 15 at this time and this would have resulted in an unviable intake because there would not be enough students enrolled.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Option 2: Delay opening</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The other option considered was to delay the opening of the tertiary high school until broader legislative change could be enacted. There is an Education and Training Bill that has Category 4 on the 2009 legislation programme–to proceed to Select Committee in 2009. This will be used to make necessary changes to accommodate a range of initiatives at the secondary/tertiary interface. However, MIT has been working towards establishing the tertiary high school for some years and the Government is keen to see it begin at the start of 2010 so that this model of education can be evaluated.</text>
