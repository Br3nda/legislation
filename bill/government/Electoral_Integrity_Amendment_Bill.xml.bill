          <text>This Bill amends the Electoral Act 1993 (<quote.in quote="1">the principal Act</quote.in>) in order to enhance public confidence in the integrity of the electoral system. It is also designed to enhance the maintenance of the proportionality of political party representation in Parliament as determined by electors. The Bill reinstates the operative provisions of the Electoral (Integrity) Amendment Act 2001, which expired at the close of 17 September 2005. The Government believes that these provisions are a useful part of New Zealand's  constitutional framework and should be reinstated permanently.</text>
