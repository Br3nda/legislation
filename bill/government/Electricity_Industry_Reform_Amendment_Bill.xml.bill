        <para>
          <text>The purpose of this Bill is to implement 3 main policy changes.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The first is to make it easier for owners of lines businesses to sell the output of the generation they were permitted to own under the 2001 and 2004 amendments to the Electricity Industry Reform Act 1998 (<def-term id="DLM1100198">EIRA</def-term>). The objective here is to encourage the owners of lines businesses to invest in permitted generation, especially generation from renewable energy sources.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This policy objective is achieved by—</text>
          <list>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>allowing sales of electricity of up to 100% of the nominal annual output capacity of permitted generation. (Previously, allowed sales were the actual output of the generating station, which could be very variable over time, especially in the case of generation from a renewable energy source, making it difficult to retail to customers):</text>
              </para>
            </item>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>allowing electricity generated from permitted generation to be traded via financial hedges (to manage spot market risks):</text>
              </para>
            </item>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>lowering the cost of corporate separation and compliance with arm’s-length rules by—</text>
                <list>
                  <item>
                    <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
                    <para>
                      <text>raising the threshold for requiring compliance to 10 MW (up from the higher of 5 MW or 2% of maximum demand):</text>
                    </para>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                    <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
                    <para>
                      <text>allowing the same person to be a director of both lines and supply (generation and retailing) businesses, while requiring at least 1 independent director and not permitting executive directors:</text>
                    </para>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                    <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
                    <para>
                      <text>allowing the same person to be a manager of both companies up to a threshold of 30 MW. (Joint staff and premises are permitted without limit.)</text>
                    </para>
                  </item>
                </list>
              </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The second main change is to narrow the scope of ownership separation requirements to focus on the geographic areas where there is potential for the exercise of market power and anti-competitive practices, namely, where lines and supply are co-located.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This is achieved by allowing owners of lines businesses to be involved in generation and retailing without limits outside of their lines area. Requirements for corporate separation and compliance with arm’s-length rules are also repealed outside of their lines area.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>At the same time, existing ownership separation rules are retained where lines and supply are co-located. This is because co-owned, co-located lines and supply businesses have both the incentive and ability to lessen competition in retailing and local generation. Ownership separation removes this incentive and ability.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Where co-located cross-ownership of lines and supply is permitted in order to encourage investment in permitted generation, corporate separation and the requirement to act on an arm’s-length basis is retained in order to reduce the risks of anti-competitive behaviour.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The third main change is to amend the definition of renewables. Currently, the owner of a lines business may only invest without quantity limitations in <amend.in quote="1">new renewables</amend.in>, which are defined to exclude hydro and geothermal generation using traditional technologies. The new definition includes all renewables, to reflect the Government policy of encouraging the development of renewable energy.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The Electricity Industry Reform Act 1998 (the <def-term id="DLM1100403">Act</def-term>) required full ownership separation between electricity lines (distribution and transmission) and electricity supply (retail and generation) businesses.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Act has been amended twice. In 2001 the Act was amended to enable lines companies to invest in new renewable generation without limit, and to own any generation up to the higher of 5 MW or 2% of lines peak load, in order to encourage investment in renewable generation and allow lines companies to use generation to support lines functions where that is efficient. A 2004 amendment allowed lines companies to own generation up to 50 MW or 20% of peak load and unlimited reserve generation contracted to the Electricity Commission to improve security of supply.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In addition, changes made to the regulatory regime and market structure since 1998 collectively go some way toward safeguarding against potential abuse of market power. These include targeted price control and information disclosure requirements under Part 4A of the Commerce Act 1986, use-of-system agreements with retailers, and powers to regulate terms and conditions for access to lines by generators (regulations are still under development and should be in place at the end of 2006).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Currently, the Act allows lines companies to invest in unlimited quantities of new renewable generation and in new non-renewable generation up to 50 MW or 20% of lines peak load. Below a threshold of 5 MW or 2% of lines peak load, there are no requirements for line companies owning generation, but above this threshold lines companies must comply with corporate separation and arm’s-length rules.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Corporate separation requires lines companies to set up a separate legal entity for any cross-owned electricity supply business. Arm’s-length rules outline permitted governance arrangements for the 2 entities, including requirements for separate directorship and management, duties not to discriminate in favour of companies in common ownership, prohibitions on sharing information, and requirements for financial separation.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Lines companies also cannot currently hedge the output of their generation for risks related to electricity prices and trade in spot energy.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Lines companies may seek an exemption from any or all of these restrictions from the Commerce Commission. The criterion for approval of exemptions by the Commission is that the purposes of the Act (primarily to ensure effective separation of lines and generation/retailing and to promote competition in generation and retailing) would be facilitated.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Lines businesses have invested very little in generation since 1998, despite amendments to the Act to encourage investment. Lines businesses argue that this is because the corporate separation and arm’s-length rules are difficult to comply with, an inability to trade in hedges and financial instruments makes selling the output of their plant difficult, and seeking exemptions from the provisions of the Act is too challenging because of time taken and the uncertainty involved.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>To facilitate investment in generation by lines companies, it is necessary to examine the legislative issues that lines companies state are barriers to their investment to see if current settings are appropriate or if there are unnecessary impediments to investment.</text>

          <text>This option would completely remove the quantity restrictions on lines companies investing in generation and retail. (In effect the Act would be repealed). This option is not preferred, because removal of ownership separation requirements will not only increase investment in generation but will also increase the ability of lines companies to engage in anti-competitive behaviour, including cross-subsidies between line and supply businesses, may allow regional monopolies in the electricity market to emerge, and may lead to lines companies making risky or non-commercial investments.</text>

However, the indicative cost of this proposal to the Commerce Commission is estimated at $300,000 to $500,000 and, given that few exemption requests are likely to be received, this additional cost is not merited. In addition, if other proposals are implemented, there are likely to be fewer exemptions sought anyway:</text>

              <text>allowing lines companies to invest in generation and retail to customers outside their local lines region without limit without complying with corporate separation and arm’s-length rules (except accounting separation). This would allow lines companies to invest in generation where there was no conflict of interest with other generation in the local network, and where the lines company did not have access to privileged information about customers. A monitoring regime would be put in place to ensure cross-owned supply businesses only retail within their lines region the output of any generation owned within that lines region (that is, connected to local lines). This would likely be in the form of an audited statement to the Commerce Commission annually confirming that the quantity of electricity sold over a calendar year to customers connected to its lines does not exceed the limit of nominal generation capacity owned by the lines company and connected to its lines.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Lines companies and their cross-owned supply businesses</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The proposals will facilitate lines companies’ investment in generation. There will be benefits for lines companies that choose to invest in generation in terms of reducing transaction costs and providing greater certainty for investment by allowing directors to retain an overview of investments, reducing overhead costs for smaller levels of investment by raising the corporate separation generation threshold to 10 MW, better managing returns from investment through being able to use financial instruments such as hedges, enabling investment in situations where there are no incentives on lines companies to behave anti-competitively, and improving the synergies available through co-optimisation of investment between lines and generation. It should be noted that some lines companies would be worse off as a result of the removal of the 2% threshold. However, corporate separation costs will be similar for all lines businesses regardless of the size of the lines business.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>For lines companies that choose not to invest in electricity generation, or which invest in electricity generation below the 5 MW generation threshold or 2% peak load threshold (to be raised to a 10 MW threshold), there will be no change in compliance costs. Those lines companies that choose to invest above the threshold will incur increased compliance costs. These are discussed in the business compliance cost statement. However, the benefit to lines companies of being able to invest in and sell generation is likely to be greater than the cost of compliance with requirements that enable them to do so.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Generators/retailers</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>There are risks that lines companies investing in generation may engage in anti-competitive practices, disadvantaging generator/retailers competing in the same markets, for example, through cross-subsidisation from their lines business to their supply business, or through concealing costs within their monopoly line charges. However, these risks are substantially reduced by the Commerce Commission monitoring the price threshold regime and information disclosure requirements set out in Part 4A of the Commerce Act 1986 and, therefore, will be able to be managed within existing regulatory frameworks, which have changed substantially since 1998.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Transpower/transmission</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>It is unlikely that the proposals in this paper will impact significantly on the transmission sector. If lines companies invest in electricity generation, it is likely to be within their own lines networks, or other distributed generation, and may lead to a reduced need for investment in the national grid.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Society</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The proposal is likely to result in a net benefit for consumers. Increased investment in electricity generation will enhance security of electricity supply and increase supply and competition, which can act to ensure that delivered electricity costs and prices are subject to sustained downward pressure. In particular, there may be benefits for communities in remote areas, where local generation could contribute to economic development (eg, wood processing), and in cases where the cost of distributed generation is significantly lower than the costs of upgrading transmission, the proposal may lead to lower prices. Costs and risks of cross-subsidy and anti-competitive practices to consumers will be managed within existing regulatory frameworks.</text>

        <para>
          <text>For any lines companies investing in generation above the 5 MW or 2% peak load threshold (to be raised to a 10 MW threshold), there will be a compliance cost associated with a monitoring regime to ensure that their affiliated supply businesses are complying with requirements to retail within their local lines region only the output of any generation owned within that lines region (that is, connected to local lines). Lines companies would be required to provide an audited statement to the Commerce Commission each year confirming that the quantity of electricity sold over a calendar year to customers connected to its lines does not (on average over the 12-month period) exceed the limit of nominal generation capacity owned by the lines company and connected to its lines. The costs to lines companies would include the cost of keeping records of the quantity of electricity sold to customers connected to its lines, the cost of completing a statement, and the cost of obtaining an independent auditor to have that statement audited.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Compliance costs from the requirement for directors to certify on an annual basis that they are complying with arm’s-length rules will only be incurred if companies choose to share directors across the boards of lines and supply companies. If companies continue to maintain entirely separate boards, costs will remain the same. The compliance cost from certification will be small—directors will be required to sign a statement each year certifying that they will comply with arm’s-length rules and send this to the Commerce Commission. The Commerce Commission will work with lines companies to ensure that they understand how to comply with these new requirements.</text>
