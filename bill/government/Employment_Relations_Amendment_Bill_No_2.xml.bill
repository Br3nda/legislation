          <text>This Bill amends the Employment Relations Act 2000 (the <emphasis style="bold">principal Act</emphasis>) to make changes to the following areas:</text>

              </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The purpose of the Bill is to provide more flexibility, greater choice, and ensure a balance of fairness for both employers and employees in the principal Act while improving its overall operation and efficiency. These changes will allow for employment problems to be resolved more quickly, reduce costs, support more efficient, effective, and flexible processes around ending the employment relationship, and help restore the confidence of all parties in the personal grievance system and the employment institutions. It is also intended that by assisting employment relationship problems to be resolved more quickly the negative impact of these problems on workplace productivity will be reduced.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Union access to workplaces with consent of employer</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill amends the principal Act by providing that union access to workplaces is conditional on the consent of the employer, but such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. The intention is that existing provisions and case law on when access is reasonable will inform notions of when withholding consent is unreasonable. This may include the grounds on which consent has been denied and the manner in which it has been denied. This change is intended to increase levels of choice and fairness for employers by enabling them to regain more control over who is on a worksite, and when. The change recognises that employers have the authority to control who comes into the workplace at any time. This authority is important for a number of reasons, including commercial sensitivity, security, and business productivity. It ensures employers can better determine when access occurs, for example, at a time when business operations are not unduly disrupted.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Providing more discretion to employers over how and when unions can access workplaces could result in stronger working relationships between employers and unions because employers would feel more in control of who is visiting, and when. Providing discretion could also enable employers to undertake better business planning; for example, avoiding any unforeseen stoppages and potentially rescheduling activities around employee availability. The intention is not to unreasonably limit access by members of a union to a union representative or unreasonably impede the ability of a union representative to undertake the lawful business of a union (and other matters as set out in section 20 of the principal Act). If an employer denies consent but does not provide reasons in writing for the refusal, the employer would be subject to a penalty action.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Clarifying that communications with employees during collective bargaining may occur</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill amends the principal Act to clarify that an employer may communicate directly with the employer's employees while bargaining for a collective employment agreement is underway (and that those communications may include the employer's proposals for the collective agreement), provided that the communications are consistent with the duty of good faith in section 32(1)(d) and section 4 of the principal Act. While the principal Act does not prohibit communication between parties in good faith, there is confusion over what this means. The Bill clarifies, to avoid doubt, that such communications may occur. Creating certainty will improve employers’ ability to undertake normal and essential business functions (for example, communications with staff) where uncertainty had previously caused them to cease such communications.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Personal grievances</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill clarifies some aspects of the personal grievance system where there is uncertainty. The changes aim to reduce compliance costs, improve resolution processes, and reduce delays in the personal grievance system.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Extending trial periods to all employers</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill extends the ability of employers and employees to agree to trial periods of 90 days or less to firms with 20 or more employees. All other existing provisions for trial periods will apply. The policy intention for trial periods remains the same as the current trial period provision that is limited to firms with less than 20 employees; that is, trial periods can improve labour market flexibility and encourage employers to take on new staff, particularly from groups that face higher levels of labour market disadvantage. Employers will have the confidence to hire new employees without facing a personal grievance on the grounds of dismissal should the employment relationship be terminated within the trial period. It is the Government’s intention that all firms have the opportunity to benefit from the trial period arrangement. Despite other limitations, employees are entitled to raise a personal grievance on the grounds of sexual or racial harassment, discrimination, or unjustified disadvantage. Access to mediation is available at any point.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Amending test of justification in section 103A</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>In 2004, amendments to the principal Act specified an objective test of justification that requires an employer, in deciding on an action, to consider and balance the legitimate interests of both the employee and employer, and requires the employer’s action and how it was done to be fair and reasonable to both parties in all the circumstances. The 2004 amendments reinstated the word <quote.in quote="1">would</quote.in> in the test of justification.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Employers have expressed uncertainty about a number of matters to do with the current test of justification. In relation to those matters, the changes in the Bill aim to address—</text>
          <list>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>the use of the word <quote.in quote="1">would</quote.in>, which is based on a false assumption that there is only 1 possible fair and reasonable course of action that can be taken by an employer (and that anything that deviates from that 1 possible course of action can be neither fair nor reasonable):</text>
              </para>
            </item>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>the current test of justification, which inappropriately obliges the Judge to substitute himself or herself for the employer and determine what the fair and reasonable employer would have done.</text>
              </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>By substituting the word <quote.in quote="1">could</quote.in> for the word <quote.in quote="1">would</quote.in> in the test of justification, the Bill recognises that there is a range of fair and reasonable responses (actions and courses of action) that could be made by an employer in any situation. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill explicitly sets out minimum requirements of a fair and reasonable process that the Employment Relations Authority (the <emphasis style="bold">Authority</emphasis>) and the courts must consider in their interpretation of the law. The Bill ensures that the employer’s processes will not be subject to a level of scrutiny that is so pedantic or technical that it means an otherwise justifiable action is considered unjust. The intention of this change is to improve employers' confidence that they will be treated fairly when defending a personal grievance claim. The change is intended to ensure that minor or technical defects in an employer's processes will not mean that an action that is substantially justified can be found to be unjustified. In addition, the Bill specifies that the employer’s resources to deal with personal grievances will be taken into consideration when determining whether a fair process has been followed.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Retaining reinstatement as remedy but removing it as primary remedy</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill retains reinstatement as a remedy for a personal grievance where practicable and reasonable, but removes it as the primary remedy under the principal Act. This change reflects common practice as reinstatement is seldom awarded. In the majority of personal grievance cases, the damage to the employment relationship is irreparable. This change would reduce the effort required for employers to demonstrate that reinstatement is neither desirable nor feasible, while having little impact on personal grievance outcomes. The intention is that the remedy remains as an option where practicable and reasonable.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Allowing mediators and Authority to make recommendations on how to resolve employment relationship problem</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill provides a new mechanism for the Authority or mediators to assist in bringing a personal grievance matter to a close, thereby achieving settlement quickly and reducing delays and costs for parties. The policy intent of this change is to enable parties to benefit from the experience and expertise of Authority members and mediators by requesting their recommendation in relation to a matter, for example, the process for resolving a problem, matters at issue, or terms of settlement. Parties will have time to consider the recommendation, and either accept or not accept it. Parties are able to benefit from the expertise and experience of the mediator or Authority member without limiting their options if they do not accept the recommendation. If the parties accept a recommendation in relation to terms of settlement, it is intended that these become final and binding in the usual way. Recommendations made under this policy change differ from the mediator’s decision-making power under section 150 of the principal Act, whereby parties who ask a mediator to make a decision are automatically bound by that decision.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Employment institutions </explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill makes changes relating to employment institutions in order to improve the operation of the system for resolving employment relationship problems. Some of the changes are designed to require the Authority to act in a more formal, prescribed, and consistent manner without undermining the investigative nature of its inquiries. Other changes include clarifying the operation of the Authority, including the accountability of Authority members to the Chief of the Authority and providing greater powers for the Authority to refer cases to the court.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Allowing penalties for obstructive or delaying behaviour</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Delays sometimes occur in the system for resolving personal grievances because of the obstructive and deliberate actions of a party. The Bill provides for the Authority to award a monetary penalty against a person (a party or representative) who, without sufficient cause, obstructs or delays an Authority investigation, including failing to attend as a party before an Authority investigation (if required). This penalty may be awarded by the Authority of its own motion or as a result of a party seeking a penalty. The provision of such a penalty is intended to act as a deterrent to delaying tactics by parties or their representatives and so reduce delays caused by such behaviours, improve efficiency, and reduce overall costs of providing problem-resolution services.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Providing for early problem resolution</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill explicitly clarifies that mediation services include early problem resolution, and that this may occur without legal representation and at the request of the parties. The intention is to clarify that early problem resolution is available within the range of mediation approaches currently provided under the principal Act, and to encourage the uptake of more flexible options; for example, mediation services can be delivered over the telephone. The reason for this change is to support early and prompt resolution of problems by the parties, highlighting that this can be achieved without the costs associated with legal representation.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Clarifying that minimum entitlements may be matter for mediation but lawful amount may not be subject of negotiation or reduction</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill clarifies that minimum entitlements cannot be negotiated away at mediation (thereby breaching the minimum code). Minimum entitlements can still be a matter for consideration in mediation, but the lawful amount of those entitlements (once determined) cannot be the subject of negotiation and possible reduction (that is, they cannot be <quote.in quote="1">traded away</quote.in>). The reason for this change is to maintain the integrity of the minimum code. A mediator will not be able to sign agreed terms of settlement that would have the effect of breaching a party's minimum entitlements.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Enabling minors aged 16 years or over to sign agreed terms of settlement</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill enables minors aged 16 or 17 years to sign agreed terms of settlement and for these agreements to be final and binding (as they are for those aged 18 years and over). The principal Act currently undermines the competency of minors to engage fully in employment relationship matters and is inconsistent with the ability of minors to sign an employment agreement with their employer. Currently, a person aged 16 or 17 years has the contractual capacity to enter into an employment relationship and the contractual capacity to settle a personal grievance arising from that relationship at the Authority. Where a minor and the employer enter into a settlement at mediation, the settlement is not considered fully enforceable until the Authority has approved it. The change will mean that minors aged 16 or 17 years are considered to be competent to sign both an employment agreement and any agreed terms of settlement in regard to any employment relationship problem.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Clarifying when parties can go to Authority without mediation</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>This change is intended to clarify the situations where mediation may be an impractical or inappropriate prerequisite to an Authority investigation. The change is consistent with other changes in the Bill that ensure that the appropriate institutions make decisions on employment disputes.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Promoting mediation as first problem-solving option</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Parties sometimes take claims directly to the Authority that could be resolved more quickly and at a lower cost at mediation. This change is intended to reduce the demand on the Authority and encourage parties to attempt mediation first, in line with the objectives of the principal Act. It will allow cases that have been to mediation (but are not settled at mediation, or are only partially settled) to be prioritised by the Authority. This prioritisation is intended to give parties confidence that, by seeking mediation first, they will not be disadvantaged should mediation prove unsuccessful. The Authority will continue to have the discretion to prioritise cases that are not amenable to, or appropriate for, mediation (as may be the case, for example, in some sexual harassment cases or in relation to a demand notice). The change is intended to promote low-cost, low-level employment relationship problem resolution, and thereby reduce the direct costs of employment problems. The change is also likely to reduce delays in the system by encouraging mediation before filing at the Authority.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Allowing only court to issue ex parte freezing order and ex parte search order</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill proposes removing the Authority’s powers to issue <emphasis style="italic">ex parte</emphasis> freezing orders and <emphasis style="italic">ex parte</emphasis> search orders and provide that these orders can only be issued by the court. This change will assist in ensuring that each institution in the employment relationship problem resolution system has the powers that are most suited to its role.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Empowering Chief of Authority to oversee operation of Authority</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill empowers the Chief of the Authority to oversee the operation of the Authority to improve transparency and accountability, particularly with regard to the conduct and training of the Authority members. Specifically, the Bill empowers the Chief of the Authority to issue instructions that outline expectations regarding the process, timeliness, or any other matters relating to the hearing and determination of matters before the Authority. The changes to the Chief’s powers aim to improve levels of accountability for the Authority’s operation, particularly with regard to the conduct and training of Authority members.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Establishing statutory right of cross-examination</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill provides a statutory right to cross-examination in the Authority. Currently, the Authority may permit cross-examination, but this is at the discretion of the Authority member. The change is intended to improve confidence that natural justice processes apply. The Authority will continue to have the ability to control the exercise of this right where, in its view, the cross-examination is not assisting the proper investigation of a matter, or is being conducted in an inappropriate manner.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Empowering Authority to refer cases to court</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Authority currently has the power to remove proceedings to the court but only if one of the parties asks it to do so. The Bill amends the principal Act so that the Authority can remove cases (in their entirety or in part) to the court at its discretion. Removal of a matter or part of a matter to the court would be based on the existing criteria within the principal Act. The intention is to better ensure that problems are resolved by the appropriate legal body and in a timely manner. The court retains the power to refer back to the Authority cases it considers have been inappropriately referred to it by that body.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Filtering out frivolous or vexatious cases</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>This change would allow the Authority to dismiss frivolous or vexatious claims or defences of claims (or parts of a claim or a defence). This allows the Authority to dismiss cases with little or no merit without them needing to be fully investigated by the Authority, which will reduce costs and avoid stress for parties. An appeal of the Authority’s decision in these instances would go to the court (in line with current practice). If the court does not agree with the Authority’s decision, it would be referred back to the Authority for an investigation.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Requiring Authority to actively consider appropriateness of referring demand notices to mediation</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill requires the Authority to actively consider whether it is appropriate to direct demand notices that relate to minimum entitlements (relating to minimum wage and holiday entitlements) to mediation before taking such action. This change adds a new criterion to the existing criteria the Authority must consider before directing a matter to mediation.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Extending application of pre-proceeding discovery</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The court has identified that there is a problem obtaining information (<emphasis style="bold">discovery</emphasis>) from a third party before it is clear which employment institution will consider the matter. This change is intended to clarify the law by providing the court with the ability to address applications for pre-proceeding discovery where the court is not the originating body.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Imposing penalty interest for failure to comply with demand notice</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Currently, there are limited consequences for employers who do not comply with obligations in relation to wage and holiday entitlements. This change is intended to improve compliance with demand notices and individual minimum entitlements. The penalty interest provides an incentive for employers to adhere to demand notices through ongoing penalties.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Enabling cases that have been inactive for 3 years in Authority to be treated as withdrawn</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The existence of an unresolved employment relationship problem and the prospect of it being “resurrected” at any point can be stressful for employers and employees or create uncertainty for them. The Bill provides that personal grievance claims that have not been actively pursued or progressed by a party within 3 years from the last action in respect of that claim be treated as withdrawn. Such a withdrawal would achieve closure for employers and employees in relation to an otherwise unresolved claim. This change is intended to remove a possible source of stress or uncertainty for employers and employees, and improve levels of fairness for them by preventing the pursuit of an historic claim (as the existing period of limitation for filing a claim at the Authority would prevent its re-litigation). Parties will have an incentive to actively pursue a claim knowing that it would be removed from the system at a certain point if they do not do so.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Labour Inspector enforcement powers </explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Current enforcement levers, in particular, penalties and demand notices, are insufficient and inefficient ways to incentivise compliance with employment legislation by employers. They do not support appropriate responses for low-level non-compliance, nor do they adequately deter severe or long-standing non-compliance. The current system of enforcement does not effectively target non-compliant practices in workplaces. The Bill addresses this inefficiency in the current system and supports greater responsiveness to businesses and a more flexible and efficient use of inspection resources. The changes made by the Bill are intended to strengthen and improve overall compliance and fairness for both employers and employees. These changes will widen the role of Labour Inspectors from a narrow complaints focus to enable a more proactive approach to achieving compliance.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Requiring employers to retain copy of individual employment agreement or current terms and conditions of employment</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>An employment agreement is the foundation of an employment relationship. The absence of a written employment agreement can lead to uncertainty, disputes, and unnecessary costs in litigation. The intention of the change is to promote compliance with the principal Act, ensure the retention of well-maintained employment agreements which reflect the existing current terms and conditions of employment agreed by both parties, and preserve the integrity of the requirement that employees have provisions that ensure parties have written individual agreements. A failure to comply with these provisions may result in a penalty. The penalty action must be preceded by written notice of the breach to the employer and 7 working days to rectify the breach.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Increasing maximum penalty for non-compliance</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill provides that maximum penalties for non-compliance with the principal Act are increased from $5,000 to a maximum of $10,000 for individuals and from $10,000 to a maximum of $20,000 for companies and other bodies corporate. The intention of increasing the penalties is to signal to the courts that breaches are significant and warrant a higher penalty. The current penalty provisions are not adequately deterring non-compliance. Increasing penalties provides an incentive for employers to comply and conveys a public message that breaches of minimum entitlements are not conducive to good commercial practice. This change is intended to promote compliance with employment legislation and not put employers who meet or exceed their employment obligations at a competitive disadvantage.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Defining functions of Labour Inspectors</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill specifies the functions of Labour Inspectors under the principal Act, thereby clarifying and giving greater transparency to their role. A lack of clarification about the functions of Labour Inspectors currently constrains their ability to appropriately target problems and incentivise compliant practices across workplaces. Specifying Labour Inspectors' functions in the Bill provides an overall framework for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the current enforcement regime. It clarifies the role of the Labour Inspector as managing complaints as well as supporting businesses to achieve compliant practices and systems. A legislatively defined role provides public transparency in relation to the expectations of a Labour Inspector. This change is intended to promote sustainable compliance with employment legislation.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Enforceable undertakings</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Facilitating problem resolution by enabling Labour Inspectors to resolve complaints about breaches of the minimum code is not integrated into the current compliance system as a statutory measure. The Bill introduces enforceable undertakings so Labour Inspectors can negotiate an outcome of compliant practice, with willing employers, and enforce those undertakings if necessary. It is intended that if the employer does not comply with a written undertaking, the matter will be enforced through the Authority or the court. The enforceable undertaking will provide a means to acknowledge a commitment in good faith to address non-compliance. This change is intended to reduce costs for employers and employees. Enforceable undertakings may also reduce the possibility of the matter proceeding to the employment institutions and therefore reduce the amount of time required by Labour Inspectors to enforce compliance.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Improvement notices</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill provides that Labour Inspectors may issue statutory improvement notices. This is to create an incentive for non-compliant employers to improve practice. The improvement notice draws on the mechanism currently available to health and safety inspectors under the Heath and Safety in Employment Act 1992. Improvement notices have the aim of both avoiding litigation and encouraging a co-operative approach to compliance. It is intended that improvement notices provide a practical addition to the employment relations enforcement framework.</text>
