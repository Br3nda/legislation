          <text>This Bill implements government policy to make legislative provision for the promotion and protection of infant feeding through breastfeeding and for rest and meal breaks. The Bill amends the Employment Relations Act 2000 (the <emphasis style="bold">Employment Relations Act</emphasis>) to require employers to provide facilities and breaks for employees who wish to breastfeed and to provide employees with rest and meal breaks.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The objective of these amendments is to create minimum standards for a modern workforce in respect of the protection and promotion of infant feeding through breastfeeding and the provision of rest and meal breaks. Further, these amendments support government policy concerning the choices of employees, particularly regarding their work-life balance and caring responsibilities.</text>

        <para>
          <text>This Bill amends the Employment Relations Act to require employers to provide appropriate facilities and breaks for employees who wish to breastfeed (including expressing breast milk), as far as is reasonable and practicable. In determining what is reasonable and practicable, employers will be able to take into account their operational environment and resources. The breaks are unpaid unless the employee and employer agree otherwise.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The breastfeeding breaks are to be provided in addition to the rest and meal breaks described below. Where an employer and employee agree, however, the rest and meal breaks can also be used as breastfeeding breaks.</text>

        <para>
          <text>A code of employment practice must be approved by the Minister as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Bill.

The Department of Labour considers the RIA and RIS to be adequate and that they comply with the Code of Good Regulatory Practice.</text>

WHO advises that workplace support should be made available for the first 12 months after the birth of a baby, and that after that a woman should be more easily able to balance work and breastfeeding (WHO, 1997, <emphasis style="italic">WHOâ€™s Contribution to the International Labour Organisationâ€™s Law and Practice Report on Maternity Protection</emphasis>, Geneva).</text></para></footnote> This target is also supported by ILO Convention 183 on Maternity Protection, which provides for the right for women to take 1 or more breaks during the working day to breastfeed their child. These breaks are to count as time worked. Maternity Recommendation 2000, R 191 also requires, where practicable, that facilities for nursing under adequate hygienic conditions be established at or near the workplace. New Zealand has not ratified either this Convention or Recommendation 191. Their status is aspirational only.</text>

          <text>There is no explicit legal requirement for employees to have rest and meal breaks. Almost 93% of active collective agreements provide for rest and meal breaks and most commonly provide 3 breaks during an 8-hour working day. The breaks usually consist of 30â€“60 minutes for meal breaks and rest breaks are generally 10â€“15 minutes in duration. There is little information on the scheduling of breaks and this is usually at the discretion of the employer or employee in specific sectors. Little is known about whether break provisions are included in individual employment agreements, which cover a majority of the workforce. Some flow-on from collective agreements, however, is expected as occurs with other provisions.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Some problems have been identified clustered around the organisation of work in specific sectors where the nature of the job and/or the characteristics of the employees mean that provision of rest and meal breaks may be inadequate. The service and manufacturing sectors appear to be the most prone to provide less than optimal rest and meal breaks.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The scheduling and take-up of breaks may also be an issue in some workplaces. Evidence suggests that there is a lack of information available for employers when developing rosters, and scheduling and timing rest and meal breaks.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Objective</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The objective of the proposed Bill is to create minimum standards for a modern workforce in respect of the promotion and protection of infant feeding through breastfeeding and provision of rest and meal breaks. It also supports government policy concerning the choices of employees, particularly regarding their work-life balance and caring responsibilities.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Infant feeding</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The proposed Bill seeks to promote and protect infant feeding through breastfeeding by amending the Employment Relations Act 2000 (the <emphasis style="bold">Act</emphasis>) to place a statutory obligation on employers to facilitate breastfeeding in the workplace through the provision of facilities and breaks, supported by a code of employment practice. Employees would be able to access the existing remedies and enforcement measures provided by the Act in the event of a dispute with their employer concerning the provision of breastfeeding breaks and facilities.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Impacts</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>These amendments would improve the health and well-being of mothers and infants and would benefit both families and employers. It supports parentsâ€™ preferences, enabling mothers to return to work at a time of their choosing while continuing to breastfeed, and government policy to support parentsâ€™ choices on care for the child in the first year of life. Benefits for employers include: supporting employees to return to work earlier following childbirth should they choose; enhancing staff retention thus reducing recruitment and training costs; increasing employee morale and loyalty; and reducing employee absenteeism to care for sick infants.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Such a provision would impose minimal costs on employers. Small businesses may face difficulties establishing the physical infrastructure, such as private areas and refrigerators to store expressed milk, to comply with the amendments. The requirement to take all reasonable and practicable measures (taking into account their operational environment and resources), however, would assist employers to support breastfeeding employees in a way that best fits with their business conditions.</text>

        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Impacts</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>There is a risk that legislating for rest and meal breaks will be seen as reducing workplace flexibility. A legislative approach also presents a risk in sectors and industries where rest and meal breaks of specified duration and frequency are incompatible with business operations.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>These amendments, however, are consistent with the majority of active collective agreements so would be expected to support current practice and not require a significant change to current workplace practices in most instances. They would also provide a minimum code to support provision of breaks in those sectors or workplaces where provisions may be light or restricted and where vulnerable workers are likely to be present. </text>

          <text>The proposed commencement date for the Act is six months after the date of enactment. This is to allow sufficient time for employers to make any necessary adjustments to comply with the new requirements of the Act. It will also allow the Department of Labour sufficient time to prepare for the implementation of the Act, including communicating the new rights and responsibilities to affected parties.</text>
