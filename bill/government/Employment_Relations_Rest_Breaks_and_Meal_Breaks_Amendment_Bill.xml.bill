        <para>
          <text>This Bill amends the Employment Relations Act 2000 (the <emphasis style="bold">principal Act</emphasis>) to implement government policy on relaxing rest break and meal break provisions for employees. Relaxing legislative provisions on rest breaks and meal breaks through this Bill will move the focus from prescription to flexibility, encouraging employers and employees to negotiate in good faith about workable arrangements regarding how rest breaks and meal breaks should be taken. Under the Bill, there will be a requirement either for meal breaks and paid rest breaks or compensatory measures. The Bill introduces flexibility for workplaces to time rest breaks and meal breaks to suit service or production continuity, as far as is reasonable, with an employer being able to determine the arrangement where agreement cannot be reached.  In particular, it provides for those circumstances in which it is necessary for breaks to have some restrictions on them because of the nature of work being undertaken. The Bill also provides flexibility for employers and employees to agree that, instead of a break, there will be compensatory measures (for example, later start or earlier finish times or time off in lieu).</text>

A compensatory measure is defined as a measure that is designed to compensate an employee for a failure to provide rest breaks and meal breaks.

        <para>
          <text>A regulatory impact statement (<emphasis style="bold">RIS</emphasis>) was required for the initial Cabinet paper recommending changes to statutory provisions on rest breaks and meal breaks. A regulatory impact statement was not prepared at that time. Had an RIS been prepared, it would have required independent assessment by the Treasury’s Regulatory Impact Analysis Team (<emphasis style="bold">RIAT</emphasis>).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Based on the limited information available, the current set of proposals is also likely to have a significant impact on economic growth and therefore requires independent assessment by RIAT. An RIS has been developed but not provided to RIAT for assessment. The proposed amendments to rest breaks and meal breaks provisions have been developed at speed and without significant consultation.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Status quo and problem</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>Under the status quo, employers and employees are encouraged to work out mutually satisfactory arrangements that fit within current legislative provisions, and can draw on the mediation services of the Department of Labour to assist them to do so. There are flexible provisions within the legislation on when breaks can be taken.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There is concern in both the public and private sectors about the workability of the rest breaks and meal breaks provisions of the principal Act. It appears likely that the current provisions may be overly prescriptive in practice in relation to what constitutes a genuine break and the extent of flexibility about when it may be taken. This appears to be limiting the capacity of workplaces in some sectors to implement rest breaks and meal breaks that comply with the legislation and do not compromise service or production continuity. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Under the status quo, an inability to reach agreement on rest breaks and meal breaks in the air traffic sector risks causing disruption to scheduled air traffic services in sole watch tower-operated regional airports to enable rest and meal breaks to be taken. These watch towers are planned to close during breaks as from 1 November 2009. This would be likely to have a negative effect on regional economies, affecting both business and tourist traffic.  </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There are indications the current provisions are creating difficulties in other sectors as well, particularly in sole-charge situations. Employees in such circumstances may need to maintain a level of situational awareness during breaks such that the breaks are likely to be considered to be of an insufficient nature. Amending legislation to increase the flexibility of the principal Act appears to be the safest route, legally, to address the problem.</text>

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Objectives</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The objectives for considering options are effectiveness; timeliness in addressing the current air traffic control problem; consistency with the objectives of the principal Act; cost-effectiveness; minimisation of regulatory compliance cost; and minimisation of potential risks to other government priorities.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Although this option has the benefit of addressing the present problem in sole-operated watch towers in regional airports, it carries a number of legal risks.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Exempt essential services from the requirement to comply with Part 6D</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>This would have the advantage of limiting regulatory impact to certain defined services. However, it carries risks of creating further pressure for ad-hoc exemptions on other provisions, and opening up ongoing requests for Ministerial intervention in particular cases. It could also give the impression that some employers have no obligation to consider the rest breaks and meal breaks needs of their employees, encouraging a focus on gaining an exemption rather than developing workable arrangements in good faith.  If it resulted in a large majority of the workforce being exempt from the requirement, it could severely undermine the purpose of having rest breaks and meal breaks provisions. There are potentially significant administration costs and regulatory compliance costs in determining the set of services to be exempted.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Repeal Part 6D of the principal Act</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Under this option, Part 6D of the principal Act would be repealed so that the situation would revert to that which was in place before 1 April 2009. That is, there would continue to be a requirement on employers to provide needed rest and opportunity for refreshment during the working day under the requirements of the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 relating to the employer’s duty of care in relation to fatigue.  The current circumstances do not appear to warrant this course of action, and it would be likely to be viewed by employees and unions as a unilateral removal of an employment right. Some employers might interpret it as a mandate to withdraw appropriate rest break and meal break entitlements negotiated with employees. Repeal could also create a legislative gap by removing the element of the principal Act that provides for rest breaks required for well-being and work-life balance.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Relaxing the rest break and meal break provisions of the principal Act as proposed would improve the workability of the rest break and meal break provisions and improve consistency with the overall intent of the principal Act.  It would also improve consistency with the flexible provision for infant feeding breaks and facilities in Part 6C of the principal Act, and consistency with provision for flexible working arrangements for people with caring responsibilities set out in Part 6AA of the principal Act.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It would have the advantage of both addressing the problem relating to sole-operated air traffic control tower staff and addressing concerns about what constitutes a break in other sectors as well.  It maintains a clear signal that employees should be able to have rest breaks and meal breaks, but does not do so in a way that imposes a compliance cost on business or an administrative cost on government.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The following government agencies were consulted on issues and options for addressing the air traffic control disagreement about rest and meal breaks, and have been informed of the contents of this paper: the Ministry of Transport, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, the Treasury, the Crown Law Office, the Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit, and Te Puni Kōkiri. The Ministry of Transport consulted the Civil Aviation Authority earlier on the issues in air traffic control towers. Due to time constraints, wider consultation with other relevant stakeholders has not occurred, including Business New Zealand and the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, although the Bill has been discussed in general terms with these organisations.</text>
