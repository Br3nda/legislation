          <text>This Bill amends the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 (the <emphasis style="bold">HSE Act</emphasis>) to provide clarity regarding collaboration in multi-business workplaces; to ensure consistency with the Evidence Act 2006 in relation to the privilege against self-incrimination; and to provide a funding mechanism through the Health and Safety in Employment levy (the <emphasis style="bold">HSE levy</emphasis>) for the enforcement of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 (the <emphasis style="bold">HSNO Act</emphasis>) in respect of hazardous substances in places of work.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The Bill amends the HSE Act to create an explicit duty for duty holders in multi-business workplaces to collaborate in meeting their hazard management and other duties under the Act.  This amendment will strengthen New Zealand's conformity with the International Labour Organization Convention 155 ( the <emphasis style="bold">ILO Convention 155</emphasis>) (concerning workplace health and safety) by reinforcing the need for employers and others to meet their existing duties.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill frames the duty in a way that is logically consistent with the HSE Act as a whole, while being flexible and non-prescriptive for the range of situations in which it will apply.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill amends Part 2 of the HSE Act to create a new duty to collaborate where businesses share a workplace.  (Part 2 contains the core of the HSE Act's duties for employers and others to manage health and safety in the workplace.) The new duty will apply to all persons, except employees, with duties under Part 2 or Part 2A (concerning employee participation) of the HSE Act and require them to take all practicable steps to collaborate in meeting their duties in the shared workplace.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Duties regarding employee participation are included for consistency with ILO Convention 155 and to encourage joint meetings and the sharing of resources in workplaces where appropriate. This amendment provides a means and motivation for employers, people who control places of work, self-employed people, and principals of contractors who share a workplace to engage with each other on managing health and safety.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Consistency with Evidence Act 2006</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>This Bill amends the HSE Act in relation to the privilege against self-incrimination so that the HSE Act is consistent with the Evidence Act 2006. The amendment means that an individual representing a body corporate will not be able to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination in respect of information that may incriminate the body corporate during an investigation into alleged HSE offending by the body corporate.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>An individual will still be able to invoke his or her own privilege against self-incrimination and to refuse to provide information that may incriminate the individual.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The Department of Labour enforces both the HSE Act and the HSNO Act in workplaces. The Bill amends section 59 of the HSE Act to enable the HSE levy to be collected for the purpose of funding the department's hazardous substances enforcement activities under section 97 of the HSNO Act. This amendment will allow the costs of enforcing the hazardous substances provisions of the HSNO Act in workplaces to be recovered from businesses. In addition, the provision will apply to HSNO Act enforcement in respect of places of work by HSNO Act enforcement agencies that are also designated agencies under the HSE Act.</text>

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Executive summary</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill addresses 3 particular policy problems: funding mechanisms for workplace Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 (the <emphasis style="bold">HSNO Act</emphasis>) enforcement; clarity regarding collaboration in multi-business workplaces; and consistency with the Evidence Act 2006.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill proposes an amendment to the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 (the <emphasis style="bold">HSE Act</emphasis>) to enable a fuller range of options for addressing the funding of HSNO Act enforcement activities in workplaces. This proposal responds to the Department of Labour's (the <emphasis style="bold">department</emphasis>) HSNO Act baseline funding being very low, and the cessation of the interim funding in 2009 reducing the department's HSNO Act enforcement services by 50%.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill also proposes creating an explicit duty for duty holders in multi-business workplaces to collaborate. In the process of ratifying the International Labour Organization Convention 155 (the <emphasis style="bold">ILO Convention 155</emphasis>) (concerning workplace health and safety), the issue of how New Zealand law and policy addresses collaboration in multi-business workplaces arose.  In addition, this amendment will strengthen New Zealand's conformity with ILO Convention 155.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Finally, the Bill proposes the removal of the privilege against self-incrimination under section 31(6) of the HSE Act as it applies to bodies corporate. This will better align the HSE Act's enforcement processes with the Evidence Act 2006.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The department has responsibility under section 97 of the HSNO Act for enforcement of hazardous substances in workplaces. This comprises 80% to 85% of HSNO Act enforcement activity.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The department's HSNO Act baseline funding is very low, and HSNO Act enforcement services will be compromised unless funding continuity is addressed and, potentially, increased. The absence of a funding mechanism has affected the level of funding provided for the department's HSNO Act enforcement.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The main source of funding under previous legislation for hazardous substance enforcementâ€”the licensing of dangerous goods by territorial authoritiesâ€”was not continued under the HSNO Act, when the department took over the enforcement role from territorial authorities.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The department is funded for both HSE Act and HSNO Act enforcement. HSE Act baseline funding is approximately $40 million per annum. HSNO Act enforcement baseline funding is approximately $1.8 million per annum ongoing, and a further $2.2 million interim funding per annum, which ceases on 30 June 2009.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Establishing a cost-recovery mechanism can only be done through a law change.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Collaboration in multi-business workplaces</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>New Zealand law addresses the issue of collaboration in multi-business workplaces through a combination of the duties of employers in relation to employees (s 6), the duties of the person in control of a place of work (s 16), and the duties in relation to the principal-contractor relationship (s 18). </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>However, the department's understanding is that because the legislation is not explicit in requiring collaboration, some employers interpret it as the absence of a requirement to establish or participate in collaboration. Where businesses are attempting to take all practicable steps to meet their obligations through collaboration, this may not be supported, as other businesses may not see collaboration as necessary to meet their own legal obligations. This suggests there is scope for improved compliance with the HSE Act's intent.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There have been several health and safety failures in workplaces such as airport baggage handling areas, port facilities, and shopping centres where a failure of businesses to collaborate to manage hazards has been a significant factor.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Requiring employers and others in multi-business workplaces to collaborate to meet their duties as an employer, principal, or person in control of a place of work, would codify the duty to collaborate in a manner that is consistent with the intention of the HSE Act and would strengthen conformity Article 17 of the ILO Convention 155 (relating to occupational safety and health), which New Zealand ratified in June 2007.</text>

        <para>
          <text>In addition to maintaining the status quo, one alternative option was considered to address the absence of a mechanism to fund the department's HSNO Act enforcement activities, namely to establish a separate levy on businesses through the HSNO Act.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Establishing a new levy under the HSNO Act would have allowed greater flexibility in HSNO Act enforcement cost recovery, enabling it to apply to a wider range of hazardous substances activities.  Nevertheless, a new levy on businesses under the HSNO Act would have necessitated additional administration costs for government and businesses.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This option was not supported, as a code only outlines how to meet a duty as stated in the HSE Act.  If the duty is not explicit, the code is of doubtful value.  In addition, guidance, in itself, is unlikely to provide a clear enough standard for prosecution or other enforcement action to bring about the practice that is more consistent with ILO Convention 155. It would also mean an absence of case law to reinforce the legal expectation.</text>

        <para>
          <text>A regulation could be developed under the Health and Safety in Employment Regulations, rather than in the primary legislation.

        <para>
          <text>Furthermore, it would allow HSNO enforcement costs in workplaces to be recovered from businesses, without additional administrative costs on those businesses.

        <para>
          <text>The preferred option to ensure consistency with the Evidence Act 2006 is to amend the HSE Act in relation to the privilege against self-incrimination. The impact of this will be that an individual representing a body corporate will not be able to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination in respect of information that may incriminate the body corporate during an investigation into alleged HSE offending by the body corporate.  An individual will still be able to invoke his or her own privilege against self-incrimination and to refuse to provide information that may incriminate the individual.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This is the preferred option because only an amendment to the HSE Act can ensure that the HSE Act is not inconsistent with the Evidence Act 2006 in relation to the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>

        <para>
          <text>There are no direct financial implications from amending section 59. However the proposed amendment will enable consideration of a wider range of options for funding HSNO enforcement in workplaces. This subsequent work programme will canvass the following four main options:</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The review of HSNO funding in workplaces will include decisions on administrative matters, for example the levy rate mechanism. The HSE levy can be applied as a single rate across all employers and self-employed, or as different rates applied to different businesses.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The process of changing the levy rate is done under the Health and Safety in Employment (Rates of Funding Levy) Regulations 1994 and involves separate consultation requirements, including a regulatory impact analysis.</text>

        <para>
          <text>In relation to the amendment to Part 2 of the HSE Act to require collaboration, there will be an information campaign for sectors particularly affected, such as construction and civil aviation.  This will be organised in conjunction with the Civil Aviation Authority (<emphasis style="bold">CAA</emphasis>) and Maritime New Zealand (<emphasis style="bold">MNZ</emphasis>).  </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Sector groups, CAA, and MNZ will be encouraged to develop guidance appropriate to their industry in the lead up to the new requirement coming into force.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Evidence Act 2006</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Once the amendment is in force, a person representing a body corporate who seeks to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination on behalf of that body corporate during a HSE investigation will be informed that the privilege does not apply to bodies corporate.</text>
