        <explnote.subhead1>Paying out annual holiday entitlement</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>This Bill will allow an employee and employer to agree that an employer may pay out up to 1 week of an employee’s minimum annual holiday entitlement in any 1 entitlement year, at the employee’s request. Allowing employers and employees to agree that up to 1 week of an employee’s minimum annual holiday entitlement may be paid out does not affect current agreements that employers and employees may have to pay out any annual holiday entitlements that are above the minimum statutory entitlement of 4 weeks.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Policy intent</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The statutory provision for annual holidays recognises the importance of providing employees with the opportunity for rest and recreation and promotes work-life balance. However, there may be some individual circumstances where an employee would prefer to exchange up to 1 week of his or her annual holidays for payment. Allowing a portion of an employee’s annual holiday entitlement to be paid out provides employees with more choice about how they exercise their minimum entitlement to annual holidays. Employees can either take annual holidays as holidays away from work or agree that a portion of their annual holidays be paid out. This change does not alter employees’ minimum entitlement to 4 weeks’ annual holidays.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Employees may only request payout of annual holidays to which they are entitled</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>An employee's request to have a portion of his or her annual holidays paid out only applies to annual holidays to which the employee is entitled. An employer and employee cannot agree to pay out annual holidays in advance of the employee's entitlement arising.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Maximum of 1 week’s annual holidays may be paid out in entitlement year</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>A maximum of 1 week’s annual holiday entitlement may be paid out in any 1 entitlement year, regardless of any existing entitlements from previous years. It is possible for employees to request that less than a week be paid out. Setting a maximum on the amount of holidays that may be paid out in any entitlement year ensures that employees still have a minimum of 3 weeks’ annual holidays away from work in the course of the year.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Payment for annual holidays paid out</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The proposal in the Bill to allow an employee to request that a portion of his or her annual holidays entitlement be paid out is not intended to provide financial incentives for paying out or taking annual holidays away from work. For this reason, the same rate of pay is to be used for paying out annual holidays and taking annual holidays away from work.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Protections for employees and employers</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The criteria for paying out annual holidays provide protections to employers and employees and ensure that both parties have a common understanding of their agreement. There must be a genuine agreement between an employer and employee, which can only be instigated by the employee. Employees cannot be pressured into requesting that a portion of their annual holidays be paid out, and employers cannot be pressured to agree to a request for a payout. </text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Employer may have policy preventing payout</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Employers may have a policy that the employer does not have to consider an employee's request to have a portion of his or her annual holidays paid out. Employers are expected (but are not required by the Bill) to consult their employees on the development of any policy preventing the payout of annual holidays and advise potential new employees of the policy before they accept an offer of employment. This is intended to lower compliance costs for those businesses that are never able to or do not wish to agree to paying out annual holidays. It means that employers do not have to consider requests that they would never agree to and that they are up front with employees about their position on paying out annual holidays. It is not intended that a policy limiting the ability to pay out annual holidays can be extended to the taking of annual holidays as holidays away from work.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2> Enforcing payout provisions</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>It is intended that Labour Inspectors and the Employment Relations Authority should have the powers required to enforce compliance with the paying out of annual holidays to ensure that employees receive their minimum entitlement to annual holidays. This includes extending Labour Inspectors' powers to bring an action for penalties relating to an employee’s entitlement to, and payment for, annual holidays that are paid out. In line with their existing powers, Labour Inspectors will have the ability to determine the amount the employer is required to pay out and the portion of annual holidays being paid out where employers and employees cannot agree on 1 or both of these amounts (or on what was originally agreed between them). The Bill also provides that if an employer has incorrectly paid out a portion of the employee's annual holidays, the paid out portion of the employee's annual holidays is restored to the employee’s annual holidays’ balance, despite the payment being made.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Calculating pay for public holidays, alternative holidays, sick leave, and bereavement leave</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill provides for the payment of either relevant daily pay or average daily pay for public holidays, alternative holidays, sick leave, and bereavement leave. The Bill seeks to address the issues raised with the current provisions on relevant daily pay by making changes to when an employer may apply an averaging formula and the period the averaging formula applies to. The policy intent behind both relevant daily pay and average daily pay is to ensure a fair rate of pay for leave (particularly where a calculation is required to determine the rate of pay) and to ensure that an employer is able to assess quickly whether relevant daily pay or average daily pay applies to an employee. The policy intent of relevant daily pay remains unchanged (that is, paying employees what they would have earned had they worked on the day so that employees are not financially disadvantaged). The policy intent for the average daily pay calculation is that the method for calculating this average daily rate is simple to apply and does not create financial incentives for employers or employees to request, refuse, or require leave to be taken at any particular time or times.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Average daily pay replaces the current 4 week averaging formula provided in section 9(3) of the principal Act. When calculating payment for leave, employers are still required to attempt to determine what an employee would have earned on the day (relevant daily pay) in the first instance. However, the trigger for when an employer may move to an averaging formula has been made more permissive. The averaging formula may be used when it is not possible or practicable to determine what the employee would have earned or where an employee’s daily payment varies within the pay period in which the holiday or leave falls. In those situations, an employer may choose to continue to attempt to determine the employee’s relevant daily pay or move to the average daily pay calculation. Where it is not possible to determine the employee’s relevant daily pay, the employer must pay according to the employee’s average daily pay. Employers and employees will still be allowed to agree to a rate of pay for public holidays, alternative holidays, sick leave, or bereavement leave that is equal to, or greater than, relevant daily pay.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Transferring observance of whole public holiday to another working day</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill amends the principal Act to restore the ability of employers and employees to agree to transfer the observance of the whole of a public holiday to another working day. This change is intended to provide greater choice for employers and employees. The agreement may be with 1 employee or a group of employees, and may relate to the transfer of 1 or more public holidays. Employers and employees may agree to transfer public holidays because of the operational needs of the employer or the individual needs of the employee. For example, if Waitangi Day falls on a Wednesday, an employer and a group of employees who work Monday to Friday may agree to observe Waitangi Day on the Friday. Similarly, an employee may agree with his or her employer that he or she can observe Boxing Day on another working day that holds religious or cultural significance for the employee. The Bill sets out a number of criteria that employers and employees must meet if they wish to transfer a public holiday. Those criteria are designed to address previous concerns around determining whether there is a genuine agreement to transfer the public holiday. As with paying out a portion of annual holidays, employers may have a policy that the employer does not have to consider requests to transfer public holidays. It is intended that employers and employees will still be able to agree to transfer part of a public holiday as currently provided for in section 44A of the principal Act.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Allowing employers to direct when alternative holiday must be taken</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill amends the principal Act to change who can determine when an alternative holiday is to be taken if an employer and employee cannot agree. If an employer and employee are unable to reach agreement, the employer may reasonably determine when the alternative holiday is to be taken, irrespective of when the entitlement to an alternative holiday arose. The employer must give the employee at least 14 days’ notice of the date on which the employer requires the alternative holiday to be taken. This change addresses concerns that the current arrangements can have a negative impact on business operations and productivity if employees choose to take an alternative holiday on a day that is not convenient for the operation of the employer’s business.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Additional factor for determining otherwise working day in section 12</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill amends section 12(3) of the principal Act to insert an additional factor for determining what would otherwise be a working day. This factor is based on the current tool used by Labour Inspectors and is recognised in case law. It does not change the meaning of what would otherwise be a working day. </text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Employers may request proof of sickness or injury within 3 consecutive calendar days without having reasonable grounds to suspect that sick leave is not genuine</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill amends section 68(1A) of the principal Act to remove the requirement for an employer to have reasonable grounds to suspect that sick leave is not genuine before the employer can request proof of sickness or injury within 3 consecutive calendar days of an employee taking sick leave. This change is intended to reduce compliance costs for employers. Employers are still required to meet an employee’s reasonable expenses in obtaining the proof.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Clarifying employee entitlements during closedown period</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill aims to clarify the original policy intent of the principal Act. It clarifies that an employee is entitled to be paid for public holidays, an alternative holiday, sick leave, or bereavement leave falling during a closedown period if the day would otherwise be a working day for the employee. The purpose of providing for closedown periods in the principal Act (sections 29 to 35) was to enable employers to manage their businesses while balancing the employees’ annual holiday entitlements. It was not intended to have the effect that all days within the closedown period could be agreed to be treated as not otherwise working days.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Increasing maximum penalties for non-compliance</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>A number of changes are being made to the Employment Relations Act 2000 that relate to the function and powers of Labour Inspectors. To support these changes, the Bill proposes to increase the maximum penalties under the principal Act. The intention of increasing the amount of penalty is to signal to the courts that breaches are significant and warrant a higher penalty. The current penalty provisions are not adequately deterring non-compliance. Increasing those penalties provides an incentive for employers to comply and conveys a public message that breaches of minimum entitlements are not conducive to good commercial practice. This change is intended to promote compliance with minimum standards and not put employers who meet or exceed their employment obligations at a competitive disadvantage.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Clarifying meaning of discretionary payments and allowances</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>To help ensure that discretionary payments and allowances are better understood and applied correctly, the Bill proposes to insert a definition of discretionary payments in the principal Act and to clarify the meaning of allowances. These changes reflect the existing policy intent.</text>
