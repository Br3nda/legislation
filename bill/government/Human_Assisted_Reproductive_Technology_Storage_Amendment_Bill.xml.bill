          <text>The Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Act 2004 (the <def-term id="DLM2398902">Act</def-term>) prohibits storage of a human in vitro gamete or a human in vitro embryo (being an embryo whose development has been suspended) for longer than the applicable period. The applicable period is 10 years or, if the ethics committee under the Act has, before the expiry of that 10-year period, approved a longer period in respect of the gamete or embryo, the longer period approved by the ethics committee. </text>
