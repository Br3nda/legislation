        <para>
          <text>Imprest supply is the statutory mechanism that allows Parliament to provide the Government with the authority to incur expenses and capital expenditure in advance of appropriation by way of an Appropriation Act.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This Imprest Supply Bill provides the sole financial authority from the start of the 2008/09 financial year until the Appropriation (2008/09 Estimates) Bill is passed. The amounts this Bill seeks are sufficient to provide supply until the end of August 2008.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This Bill is repealed on the coming into force of the Appropriation (2008/09 Estimates) Bill. Appropriations for expenses and capital expenditure incurred under the authority of this Bill will be sought in an Appropriation Act for the 2008/09 year.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In this Bill, imprest is calculated separately for expenses and capital expenditure, except in relation to intelligence and security departments. The expenses and capital expenditure to be incurred by those departments are included within the imprest sought for expenses in this Bill.</text>

        <para>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The amounts of supply for expenses and capital expenditure are calculated on the basis of one-sixth (2 months' worth) of the relevant annual appropriations included in the 2008/09 Estimates, adjusted for uneven timing, plus an allowance for multi-year appropriations and a general contingency provision to cover risks that may eventuate. In particular, the authority sought this year for expenses includes upfront funding attributed to Votes Education, Energy, Finance, Official Development Assistance, Revenue, State Services, and Transport, while the authority sought this year for capital expenditure includes upfront funding for Votes Defence, Education, Finance, and Transport. Of the $23,500 million required for capital expenditure, $20,540 million is for 1 side of a fiscally neutral transaction associated with the establishment of the New Zealand Transport Agency.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In addition, this Bill seeks approval for the net asset holdings of departments and Offices of Parliament to exceed the amounts confirmed in Schedule 4 of the Appropriation (2007/08 Supplementary Estimates) Act 2008 by no more than $1,000 million in aggregate.</text>
