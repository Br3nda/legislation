        <para>
          <text>Imprest supply is the statutory mechanism that allows Parliament to provide the Government with the authority to incur expenses and capital expenditure in advance of appropriation by way of an Appropriation Act.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Imprest Supply (First for 2010/11) Act 2010 provides the sole financial authority from the start of the 2010/11 financial year until the Appropriation (2010/11 Estimates) Bill is passed. In contrast, the Imprest Supply (Second for 2010/11) Bill seeks financial authority additional to that sought in the Appropriation (2010/11 Estimates) Bill.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This Bill is required to ensure the Government has sufficient supply to implement decisions taken after the 2010/11 Estimates were finalised and to meet any increases in demand-driven expenses or other risks or contingencies in excess of the amounts provided in the Appropriation (2010/11 Estimates) Bill.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The amounts this Bill seeks are intended to be sufficient to provide supply until 30 June 2011 for the incurring of expenses and capital expenditure in excess of the amounts appropriated in the Appropriation (2010/11 Estimates) Bill.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This Bill is repealed at the end of the 2010/11 financial year on 30 June 2011. Appropriations for expenses and capital expenditure incurred under the authority of this Bill must be sought in an Appropriation Act that comes into force on or before 30 June 2011. If this is not done, those expenses and capital expenditure will require validation in an Appropriation (Financial Review) Act in accordance with section 26C of the Public Finance Act 1989. Most of the expenses and capital expenditure that are incurred under this Bill will be appropriated in the Appropriation (2010/11 Supplementary Estimates) Bill. Anything that is not will be validated in the Appropriation (2010/11 Financial Review) Bill.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In this Bill, imprest is calculated separately for expenses and capital expenditure, except in relation to intelligence and security departments. The expenses and capital expenditure to be incurred by those departments are included within the imprest sought for expenses in this Bill.</text>
