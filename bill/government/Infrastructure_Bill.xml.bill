          <text>This is an omnibus Bill. It proposes substantive amendments to 8 Acts and the repeal of 1 Act. It is intended that the Bill will be divided at the committee of the whole House stage into 2 Bills, with Part 1 and the Schedule becoming the Utilities Access Bill, and Parts 2 to 4 remaining as the Infrastructure Bill. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill is being introduced under Standing Order 259(c). That Standing Order provides that an omnibus Bill to amend more than 1 Act may be introduced with the agreement of the Business Committee. That approval has been given.</text>

          <text>The development of infrastructure is central to lifting New Zealand’s national productivity and improving New Zealand’s future economic growth. Improving the consistency of regulatory arrangements for infrastructure development, streamlining governance arrangements, and removing regulatory barriers all contribute to improving the timeliness of infrastructure provision and reducing the cost of infrastructure development.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The purpose of this Bill is to progress a broad suite of amendments, across several Acts, to facilitate infrastructure development by removing unnecessary barriers and improving the consistency of regulatory arrangements.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Parts 1 and 2</emphasis> improve the arrangements for managing access by utility operators (electricity, gas, telecommunications, water, and wastewater) to transport corridors (roads, railways, and motorways). Inconsistencies or gaps in legislation and industry practice are resulting in inefficiencies, uncertainty, and disputes, leading to associated higher costs and delays. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Part 1</emphasis> establishes a framework for a national code of practice governing how utility operators and corridor managers co-ordinate their activities (the <def-term id="DLM2248902">Code</def-term>). The Part imposes an obligation on all utility operators and corridor managers to comply with the Code, unless parties otherwise agree. This obligation is backed by the ability of a court to order compliance with the Code, and to impose a fine if that court order is not complied with. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A draft Code can be prepared by any person, so as to allow industry participants to develop it and own the result, but it must meet certain requirements before it can be approved by the Minister. A Code approved by the Minister will be a deemed regulation. Its detailed subject matter requires flexibility and expertise. However, the power to make the deemed regulation is tightly defined and the processes for approving a Code are clearly laid out. The Code must reflect broad agreement between stakeholders. It must contain the method by which any statutory criteria are to be applied, and operational and dispute resolution processes. In case there is no Code that meets the requirements for approval, the Part also includes a regulation-making power that allows the Minister to issue a Code in the form of regulations in place of an approved Code that is issued as a deemed regulation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Part 2</emphasis> amends 6 Acts. Amendments to the Telecommunications Act 2001, the Electricity Act 1992, the Gas Act 1992, and the Local Government Act 1974 provide for consistent provisions across the Acts around reasonable conditions of access to the corridors, allocation of costs when utility operators are required to move assets, and time periods for notification and response. Amendments to the Railways Act 2005 and the Government Roading Powers Act 1989 provide for time frames for responding to requests for access to rail corridors and motorways, and require controlling authorities to publish criteria on which they will base their decisions to grant access.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Part 3</emphasis> amends the New Zealand Railways Corporation Act 1981 to remove some of the statutory restrictions that negatively affect the running of the New Zealand Railway Corporation’s (<def-term id="DLM2248903">NZRC</def-term>) business. These changes include normalising the appointment and dismissal of directors, changing the number of directors who can call a meeting to a simple majority, establishing the power to appoint a deputy chairperson, and streamlining arrangements for changes to NZRC's capital. It also removes the requirement to annually provide the Minister with a programme of capital works, removes the limit on how much NZRC can expend in one year and permits NZRC to effect insurance cover for or give an indemnity to a director or employee. These amendments are consistent with equivalent provisions in the Crown Entities Act 2004.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Part 4</emphasis> repeals the Affordable Housing: Enabling Territorial Authorities Act 2008 (the <def-term id="DLM2248904">AHETA Act</def-term>). The AHETA Act was intended to provide councils with the regulatory tools to address problems of housing affordability in their district. Many developers and territorial authorities have raised concerns that the Act is counter-productive and likely to reduce, rather than increase, the supply of affordable housing. The processes create regulatory barriers that contradict Government initiatives to reduce regulatory barriers and compliance costs. However, to address the growing obstacle that restrictive covenants represent to social housing within newly developed communities, a modified version of the prohibition on certain restrictive covenants, currently contained in section 30 of the AHETA Act, is being inserted into the Property Law Act 2007. The modification is that the new section applies only to covenants relating to <quote.in quote="1">social housing</quote.in>, and not also to <quote.in quote="1">affordable housing</quote.in> (as those terms are defined in the AHETA Act).</text>

Corridor managers are obliged to comply with the Code when setting reasonable conditions for access.

            <text>When utility operators exercise their statutory right of access to roads, they allege inconsistent application of <quote.in quote="1">reasonable conditions</quote.in> by local authorities; in turn, local authorities allege poor quality reinstatement of roads by utility operators. Other disquiet arises from inconsistencies in utility statutes creating advantages for some operators. The preferred option is to make utility legislation consistent where appropriate and to provide a legislated process to give legal status to  a stakeholder-created code for managing access to roads, motorways, and rail corridors, and a regulated code if considered necessary. The impacts of legislative change are that some parties will face increased compliance and resource costs, but greater benefits arise from the more certain regulatory environment for investment decisions, and the improvement in the management and co-ordination of utility works in roads, rail, and motorways. The process of engagement between stakeholders in agreeing a code of practice should produce better outcomes for all parties.</text>

            <text>Legislative provision for the access to road, rail, and motorway corridors by utility operators (electricity, telecommunications, water, sewerage, drains, and gas) is inconsistent across statutes. Inconsistencies include the notification requirements prior to works commencing (different periods, notification responsibilities, and processes); the allocation of costs when installations are moved; and the criteria for setting <quote.in quote="1">reasonable conditions</quote.in> on the works by those with jurisdiction over the transport corridor.</text>

          <para>
            <text>Utility operators have a statutory right of access to roads (subject to <quote.in quote="1">reasonable conditions</quote.in>).  The 75 local authorities have established differing requirements for works in the road, resulting in increased costs and uncertainty of compliance for regional and national utility operators. There is some voluntary use of a code of practice that improves the understanding of process and conditions between some utility operators and local authorities, but there is more than 1 code and many areas do not use one at all. Some utility operators are empowered to impose <quote.in quote="1">reasonable conditions</quote.in> on the proposed works of other utility operators in the vicinity, creating the risk of anti-competitive practices.  Utility operators do not have a right of access to motorway or rail corridors, but can request it. They describe that considerations are delayed and costly and that there is insufficient access granted.</text>

            <text>The Land Transport Management Act 2003 has as its objective an <quote.in quote="1">integrated, safe, responsive, and sustainable land transport system</quote.in>. The Ministry of Transport advises that the current level of fatal and serious injuries as a result of hitting a roadside hazard (eg, a tree, ditch, or pole) is not acceptable (50% of rural and 27% of urban crashes involve a roadside hazard or obstacle).  When local authorities wish to change the location of, for example, a utility pole that is considered a hazard or need to move utility assets in the road (because the road has been realigned), there are issues arising from the costs of this.</text>

This forum was attended by over 150 representatives of local authorities, government agencies, and utility operators. Feedback was invited and 40 responses were received: 19 district councils, 4 city councils, Auckland territorial authorities (as 1 group), Auckland Regional Transport Authority, New Zealand Transport Agency, ONTRACK, Telstra, Telecom, 4 lines companies (Vector, Powerco, Orion, and Delta  Services for Aurora Energy), NZUAG, LGNZ, 2 industry groups (Electricity Networks Association and Electrical Engineers Association), and 3 private individuals.

Stakeholders have been co-operating on developing a code of practice as the solution to address the policy problem. Representatives from Auckland territorial authorities, New Zealand Transport Agency, ONTRACK, the Gas Association of NZ Inc, the Electricity Networks Association, the Electricity Engineers Association, the Telecommunications Carriers Forum, LGNZ, and NZUAG have been meeting and working together on the issues to be addressed.  Since the further discussion paper in February 2007, momentum has increased and the stakeholder-developed final draft of the code of practice is expected to be produced by December 2007. Wider stakeholder engagement is signalled for February 2008, initiated by NZUAG.</text>

          <para>
            <text>Affordable housing is an issue of national importance, particularly in areas such as Auckland and other high growth regions in New Zealand where low and moderate income households face high housing costs. Affordable housing is defined as housing for low to moderate income and asset households at prices so that the household is able to meet its housing and other essential basic living costs.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The New Zealand Housing Strategy 2005 indicated that new regulatory tools had the potential to increase the supply of affordable housing. In response, the Affordable Housing: Enabling Territorial Authorities Act 2008 (the <def-term id="DLM2248917">Act</def-term>) was developed with the intention of addressing concerns about declining housing affordability. This legislation provided territorial authorities with new powers to increase the supply of affordable housing.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Under the Act, territorial authorities can require from developers a contribution of either money, land, houses, or a mix of these towards affordable housing. In return, councils can provide incentives to help off-set costs borne by those developers required to make an affordable housing contribution. Possible incentives include reduced development contributions, density bonuses, rates remissions or postponements, or other financial assistance.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>International and national evidence demonstrates that the regulatory powers in the Act are inadequate by themselves to increase the supply of affordable housing. This evidence indicates that more effective policy responses to increase the supply of affordable housing include: adequate provision of land for development in a timely manner, efficient development approval processes, and effective coordination of infrastructure provision.</text>

            <text>Proposed reforms to the Resource Management Act 1991, the Local Government Act 2002, and the Building Act 2004 will simplify and streamline regulatory processes for territorial authorities and reduce compliance costs for the building sector. Repealing the Affordable Housing: Enabling Territorial Authorities Act 2008 (with a restrictive covenants provision similar to section 30 of that Act to be included as a consequential amendment to the Property Law Act 2007) will also contribute to this outcome.</text>

            <text>The current lack of affordable housing is a widespread problem, internationally and in New Zealand. Nationwide, house prices have almost doubled since 2002, significantly outpacing increases in average household incomes. The reductions in interest rates and house prices over the past year have only led to modest improvements in the ability of first-home buyers to purchase a home, due to more stringent conditions that banks now require when providing credit.</text>

          <para>
            <text>The Affordable Housing: Enabling Territorial Authorities Act 2008 was intended to provide territorial authorities with the regulatory powers to address problems of housing affordability in their district. However, implementing the Act would complicate regulatory processes, and add costs and uncertainties for territorial authorities and increase costs for the building sector, which would result in an increase in housing costs more than would otherwise be the case.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Act establishes new processes for territorial authorities to follow to be able to require affordable houses. These processes present regulatory barriers which contradict Government initiatives to reduce regulatory barriers and compliance costs. The powers provided for in the Act can be effective within a high value market characterised by significant development activity and limited development opportunity.<footnote id="DLM2248918"><para><text>Gurran, N; Milligan, V; Baker, D; Bugg, L; and Christensen, S.

            <text>Repeal of the Act would have minimal effect. The Act was enacted in 2008 and while as small number of territorial authorities<footnote id="DLM2248923"><para><text>These include Waitakere City, North Shore City, Christchurch City, and Dunedin City Councils, and Rodney and Gisborne District Councils. Queenstown Lakes District Council provided an important rationale for developing the Act. However, they have proceeded with affordable housing initiatives using the Resource Management Act 1991, and not the Affordable Housing: Enabling Territorial Authorities Act 2008.</text></para></footnote> have shown an interest in using the Act, none have actually used it.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Government is instead proposing a different approach to addressing housing affordability issues. Phase 2 of the review of the Resource Management Act 1991 will consider options for a range of housing and urban planning matters, including the development of a National Policy Statement on housing affordability and a National Environmental Standard on home development.</text>

          <explnote.subhead1>Costs and benefits of repealing the Act</explnote.subhead1>
          <para>
            <text>Repealing this legislation will directly address industry and council concerns about increased costs. For instance, reducing costs, simplifying the planning system, and reducing the need for extensive and detailed assessment of minor developments will shorten approval times and alleviate more onerous planning requirements.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Repeal of the Act would, for areas that might choose to implement it, reduce prescriptive process and reduce cost and uncertainty associated with the following activities: undertaking a housing needs assessment; developing and consulting on the draft affordable housing policy; the objection and appeal processes; negotiating with developers; providing possible financial incentives to developers; retaining the affordable housing; and, monitoring and reviewing the affordable housing policy.<footnote id="DLM2248924"><para><text>For those councils that do want to use this approach, they can still do so using the Local Government Act 2002 and other means. They will not have to follow the process prescribed in the Act which is onerous, costly, and uncertain.</text></para></footnote></text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The costs that would be incurred by both territorial authorities and developers would be reflected in local house prices, particularly in the short term. Facilitating housing through the powers in the Act would add costs. Where demand is relatively elastic, implementing an affordable housing policy is likely to decrease the profit of a development to which the affordable housing policy applies. The extent of any diminished profit is difficult to estimate and depends on the following variables: the strength of the housing market, the nature of the policies put in place, and incentives provided by a territorial authority.</text>

            <text>Regulation increases the cost of housing. Analysis undertaken on housing costs in Australia in the last 5 years found that taxes, levies, and compliance costs now amount to about a third of the cost of new house and land packages, including the costs of meeting planning regulations and holding costs associated with the approval process.<footnote id="DLM2248925"><para><text>Residential Development Council, 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams: The future of housing affordability in Australia.' <emphasis style="italic">Property Council of Australia</emphasis>, Sydney, 2007.</text></para></footnote></text>
