        <para>
          <text>The primary purpose of this Bill is to improve flexibility in the Accident Compensation Scheme (<emphasis style="bold">ACC Scheme</emphasis>), facilitate cost containment, provide for closer working relationships between government agencies and the Accident Compensation Corporation (<emphasis style="bold">ACC</emphasis>), and improve financial reporting and accountability. The primary amendment will extend the date for fully funding residual claims liabilities from 2014 to 2019, set a final valuation of all residual claims liabilities as valued at 30 June 2009, and fold the residual liabilities into the main accounts.</text>

        <explnote.crosshead>Summary of key changes</explnote.crosshead>
        <explnote.subhead1>Amendments to improve flexibility</explnote.subhead1>
        <explnote.subhead2>Full funding of residual claims liabilities</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001 (<emphasis style="bold">IPRC Act</emphasis>) requires levies to be calculated to achieve full funding of residual liabilities by 30 June 2014 in the Residual Claims, Motor Vehicle, and Earners’ Accounts, but not the Non-Earners’ Account. The 2014 date was originally set in 1998, but the residual accounts are still some way from being fully funded. Volatility in levy rates is likely to increase as 2014 approaches. There is also a need to deal with over- or under-funding of the residual claims liability that would occur after 2014. The amendments will set a final date for fully funding the residual claims liabilities of 31 March 2019 for the Work and Earners’ Accounts and 30 June 2019 for the Motor Vehicle Account. The residual claims liabilities will be set as at 30 June 2009 in order to reduce volatility as the fully funded date approaches. The residual claims liabilities will be merged into the main accounts.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Enable experience rating and risk sharing in Work Account</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The IPRC Act allows an individual employer’s levy to be adjusted downward based on satisfactory safety audits, or upward based on an unsatisfactory safety audit that is triggered by the number and severity of work-related injuries experienced by the employer. The Bill allows regulations to be made for experience rating and risk sharing of levy payers in relation to Work Account levy rates, which could include no-claim bonuses, higher or lower levies, and claim thresholds; and allows all of the current ACC workplace programmes to be retained (with some modifications) alongside any new process for experience rating and risk sharing.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Enable risk rating in Motor Vehicle Account for both vehicles and vehicle owners</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill will allow regulations to be made for risk rating in relation to Motor Vehicle Account levy rates. Risk rating regulations for motor vehicles, registered owners of motor vehicles, and persons who hold trade licences under section 34(1) of the Transport (Vehicle and Driver Registration and Licensing) Act 1986 will link safety behaviour to levy payments, for example potentially offering no-claims bonuses for vehicle owners, or allowing discounts for vehicles with high safety ratings. These categories are consistent with section 216 of the IPRC Act.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Technical amendment improving access to Cover-Plus Extra for shareholder employees</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Cover-Plus Extra allows self-employed people, and people with earnings as a shareholder employee, to purchase an agreed level of weekly compensation from ACC. Although all self-employed people are eligible to apply for Cover-Plus Extra, shareholder employees are only able to apply if they have a record of earnings as a shareholder employee. There is a lack of clarity in the current legislation with regard to access to Cover-Plus Extra for people with an expectation of earnings as a shareholder employee. This especially applies to people with new businesses. The Bill makes a technical amendment to enable ACC to enter into an agreement to supply an agreed level of weekly compensation to shareholder employees who are not able to demonstrate taxable earnings as a shareholder employee.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Cost-containment amendments</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Cover and entitlements in the ACC Scheme have been expanded in recent years. The Bill includes amendments that will assist with cost savings in the ACC Scheme. These amendments include reversing changes made in 2008 to cover for work-related gradual process, disease, or infection, and changes to weekly compensation entitlements, vocational independence requirements, and disentitlement provisions. New proposals are also included, such as a threshold for cover for hearing loss.</text>

        <explnote.crosshead>Cover</explnote.crosshead>
        <explnote.subhead2>Repeal changes made in 2008 to test for causation for workplace gradual process, disease, or infection </explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill reinstates the 3-part test for workplace gradual process, disease, or infection (<emphasis style="bold">WRGPDI</emphasis>) for claims that are not covered under Schedule 2 that applied before the 2008 amendment. The pre-2008 test is easier for ACC to apply, whereas the current part of the test adds to ACC’s costs and potentially to the number of people receiving cover. This proposal removes some of the onus on ACC to prove that a claimant does not have cover.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Hearing loss claims: cover</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill requires that a person’s injury-related hearing loss must reach a 6% threshold before the person can be considered for cover.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.crosshead>Weekly compensation </explnote.crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>Weekly compensation is paid to eligible claimants regardless of whether a worker’s injury occurs at work or elsewhere. It is paid at 80% of pre-incapacity earnings, and is intended to provide <quote.in quote="1">real compensation</quote.in> so that claimants can meet their everyday expenses and focus on recovery.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Reinstate former calculations for long-term (after 4 weeks) weekly compensation for non-permanent employees</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The pre-2008 calculation divided the previous 52 weeks of earnings by 52 to derive a weekly earnings figure. Returning to this would ensure that weekly compensation for non-permanent employees would be averaged to reflect the fact that, had it not been for the injury, they would have expected periods of earnings and non-earnings over a 12-month period.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Return increasing weekly compensation to minimum weekly earnings rate from after fifth week of incapacity, instead of from second week</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Currently, low-income employees are entitled to have their weekly compensation increased to the minimum weekly earnings rate from the second week of incapacity if they were in full-time employment or self-employed immediately before their incapacity. The Bill increases weekly compensation to the minimum weekly earnings rate from after the fifth week of incapacity, as occurred before 2008. This change excludes people who are on weekly compensation for 5 weeks or less from obtaining minimum weekly compensation if their weekly compensation is below this rate and they were in full-time employment or self-employed immediately before their incapacity.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Abatement of holiday pay: return to provision that claimants’ leave entitlements after their employment ends are considered as part of weekly earnings when calculating weekly compensation</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>If a claimant receives holiday pay on the termination of employment while receiving weekly compensation, the Bill provides that this holiday pay is treated as earnings for a period equivalent to the amount of leave paid and is liable to abatement. </text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Reduce Loss of Potential Earnings (LoPE) compensation for young people back to 80% of minimum weekly earnings</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>ACC pays compensation for loss of potential earnings (<emphasis style="bold">LoPE</emphasis>) to people who have not had the opportunity to earn and are incapacitated either before turning 18, or while in continuous full-time study from the age of 18. The payment is made from the time the claimant turns 18 if the claimant has been incapacitated for 6 months or more and is not in full-time study or training. The Bill reduces the LoPE rate from 100% to 80% of adult minimum weekly earnings, which is the same rate as for other low-income claimants. At 80% of the minimum wage the payment would be $400 per 40 hour week, pre-tax. This calculation is based on the minimum weekly wage as at 1 July of the relevant year (as required by the IPRC Act). </text>
        </para>
        <explnote.crosshead>Vocational independence and rehabilitation</explnote.crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The ACC Scheme entitles injured claimants to vocational rehabilitation in order to restore the claimant to employment or employability as far as is practicable.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Replace vocational independence threshold of capacity to work for 35 hours per week with capacity to work for 30 hours per week</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The provision for vocational independence was enacted in 2001 as the claimant’s capacity to engage in work for which he or she is suited by reason of experience, education, or training, or any combination of those things, and for 35 hours per week. The Bill changes the 35 hours-per-week requirement to 30 hours per week, making the definition of full-time work consistent with that used by Statistics New Zealand, the Ministry of Social Development, and the Inland Revenue Department.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Make it optional for occupational assessors to consider pre-incapacity earnings when undertaking initial and vocational independence assessments</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill amends section 91 and clause 25 of Schedule 1 to say that <quote.in quote="1">the occupational assessor <emphasis style="italic">may</emphasis> take into account, among other things, the claimant’s earnings before the claimant’s incapacity</quote.in>. This will continue to help inform the occupational assessment process but the provision will not be mandatory. </text>
        </para>
        <explnote.crosshead>Disentitlement </explnote.crosshead>
        <explnote.subhead2>Wilfully self-inflicted injury and suicide</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Claimants who cause injury to themselves or commit suicide are covered by ACC and receive full entitlements. Before 2001, such claimants had ACC cover, but were disentitled (except for treatment) unless they had a mental injury caused by a physical injury or a mental injury caused by certain criminal acts (sensitive claims). A change made in 2001 meant that all claimants in this category with any mental injury (a clinically significant behavioural, cognitive, or psychological dysfunction) were eligible for all entitlements. The disentitlement provision remained in the IPRC Act for those who did not have any mental injury. This provision was repealed in 2008. The Bill largely reinstates the pre-2001 provision to disentitle claimants for wilfully self-inflicted personal injuries or suicide. Except for treatment, claimants with wilfully self-inflicted personal injuries will only receive entitlements other than treatment if their injuries result from a mental injury as a result of a physical injury, or from a mental injury as a result of certain criminal acts (sensitive claims), or from a work-related mental injury. However, the reinstatement of disentitlement for wilfully self-inflicted personal injuries and suicide will not affect claimants who are currently receiving entitlements for these injuries.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Strengthening disentitlement provision for claimants for whom it would be repugnant to justice to provide entitlements</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>ACC can apply to the District Court to deny entitlements wholly or in part to previously imprisoned offenders who suffered personal injury in the course of committing the offence for which they were imprisoned, where it would be <quote.in quote="1">repugnant to justice</quote.in> for the claimant to receive the entitlements. The Bill replaces the existing provision with a provision that sets specific criteria which, if met, would automatically disentitle the person from ACC cover. However, the Minister for ACC could exercise his or her discretion in cases where exceptional circumstances apply. Claimants in this group would be entitled only to treatment, and their entitlement to surgery would be limited to that which is necessary to restore function to allow a claimant to return to work.</text>

        <explnote.crosshead>Ministerial Advisory Panels</explnote.crosshead>
        <explnote.subhead2>Remove the requirement to have Ministerial Advisory Panel on Work-related Gradual Process, Disease, or Infection and Injury Surveillance Ministerial Advisory Panel</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The IPRC Act provides for 2 Ministerial advisory panels to advise on WRGPDI issues and on use and collection of injury statistics. The Bill removes the requirement for these panels. The task for which the WRGPDI Panel was established has largely been completed. If further work is required in this area the Minister is able to set up a panel at any time. The Injury Surveillance Ministerial Advisory Panel will be removed as there is no longer a need for it, as the Injury Surveillance Officials Group now undertakes a similar role.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The Bill amends the IPRC Act to allow the Inland Revenue Department to provide limited information to ACC upon request, and these amendments apply on and from 1 April 2002. A consequential amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be required.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Enable ACC to provide non-ACC-related government services or entitlements to ACC claimants</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>ACC is presently unable to undertake any service not specified in the IPRC Act unless it is done on a commercial basis via one of its subsidiaries. The Bill amends the legislation to enable ACC to provide non-ACC-related government-directed services or entitlements to ACC claimants.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Require ACC to table annually financial conditions report in Parliament</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill provides for a clause that requires ACC to provide a financial condition report annually to the Minister for ACC. The Minister for ACC will be required to table the report in the House.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The purpose of ACC’s financial condition report is to provide impartial advice in relation to ACC’s operations, financial condition, and liabilities, discussing the implications of material risks identified; and where these implications are adverse, set out operational and management responses to address these risks. The report will provide greater financial transparency of ACC operations and is consistent with existing fiscal responsibility legislation and the findings of the Ministerial Inquiry into Disclosure of Funding Shortfall in ACC Non-Earners’ Account.</text>

Under the 2008 amendment, the claimant's weekly earnings are deemed to be the amount of weekly earnings determined under clause 42(3) multiplied by 125%. The amendment under the Bill will restore the wording of clause 47(4) as it read before the 2008 amendment so that it provides that the claimant's weekly earnings are deemed to be the amount of weekly earnings determined under clause 42(3).</text>

          <text>The costs of the Accident Compensation Scheme (<emphasis style="bold">ACC Scheme</emphasis>) have been rising above the rate of inflation (the Labour Cost Index) for some years.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Some of these additional costs are due to legislated increases in cover and entitlements over time. The Government has asked for amendments to the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001 (<emphasis style="bold">IPRC Act</emphasis>) to help reduce costs. This is only the first phase of legislation. The Government will be undertaking a stocktake of all ACC Accounts, the results of which are likely to lead to further legislation in 2010. In addition, a review is planned of cover and entitlements under the ACC Scheme, the results of which may also require future legislative change</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The current amendments cover a range of proposals that trim some entitlements and cover, rescind some amendments made late last year, change the date for fully funding the Residual Claims Account, allow different sources of funding for collection of the levy for the Motor Vehicle Account, and enable experience rating in the Work Account.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Most proposals will reduce levies and Crown costs but will affect some entitlements and cover. Some costs are likely to be transferred to the Health and Social Welfare budgets. Disentitlement of claimants with wilfully self-inflicted injuries including suicide is likely to affect the families of those claimants.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Changing the final date for fully funding residual claims will reduce levies but extend the payment time further into the future to levy payers who did not incur the residual claims.

          <text>The Treasury Regulatory Impact Analysis (<emphasis style="bold">RIA</emphasis>) Team has reviewed this regulatory impact statement (<emphasis style="bold">RIS</emphasis>) and considers that it does not meet the RIS requirements. The RIS does not contain the required information and the analysis is incomplete in a number of key areas. For example, some of the proposals to remove ACC entitlements will shift costs onto other government agencies or onto individuals but the RIS does not quantify these costs. The proposal to introduce experience rating and risk sharing in the Work Account will increase administrative and compliance costs for business and for the ACC Scheme, but these costs have not yet been investigated. In addition, the RIS consultation requirements have not been met.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The ACC Scheme provides, instead of the right to sue, cover and entitlements including compensation to all people currently in New Zealand. The Scheme is funded by levies paid by employers (<emphasis style="bold">Work Account</emphasis>), workers (<emphasis style="bold">Earners’ Account</emphasis>), and motor vehicle owners (<emphasis style="bold">Motor Vehicle Account</emphasis>) as well as some Crown funding for people who are not working (<emphasis style="bold">Non-Earners’ Account</emphasis>). The Treatment Injury Account is jointly funded by the Non-Earners’ and the Earners’ Accounts.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Claims received before 1 July 1999 are paid for from residual claims accounts linked to the Work, Earners’, and Motor Vehicle Accounts. The residual claims elements of the Accounts were funded by a pay-as-you-go system before 1999 and are required by the IPRC Act to be fully funded by 2014.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Levies are charged to ensure that the current claims on the Accounts are fully funded. Levies are influenced by factors such as returns ACC makes on investments, interest rates, and discount factors, as well as numbers of claims, rehabilitation rates, and cover and entitlements. Cover and most entitlements are set by the IPRC Act and can only be changed by legislative amendment. Some entitlements are made at the discretion of ACC. ACC has responsibility for administering the Scheme. The way ACC administers the Scheme also has a significant impact on Scheme costs.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The costs of the ACC Scheme are rising rapidly above the rate of inflation (<emphasis style="bold">Labour Cost Index</emphasis>). Some of the increased costs are due to expanded cover and entitlements available under the Scheme. New claims have increased around 16.7% since 2003/04. This compares with a population increase of approximately 7.4% over the same period. The cash cost (does not include the long-term liabilities and therefore has only a partial effect on levies) of entitlements and services increased by 12% in the 2007/08 financial year. Rehabilitation rates for weekly compensation claims have been gradually decreasing since 2004/05 from a 93% 12-month rehabilitation rate to a 91% rate in 2007/08. The number of weekly compensation claims with duration of more than 1 year has increased from 13 890 at 30 June 2004 to 19 999 at 31 March 2009. Long-term liabilities have risen because of these factors but also because of decreased investment returns and a decreased discount rate, which means more funding is required to pay off liabilities. Liabilities have risen from $12,714 million at 30 June 2006 to $21,875 million (as estimated in December 2008) at 30 June 2009.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Changes made in 2008 and previously to the IPRC Act expanded cover and entitlements, thereby increasing Scheme costs and liabilities. Other existing legislative provisions, such as the requirement to fully fund residual claims by 2014, are also increasing pressure on the Scheme. Still other existing provisions, such as the inability to use the petrol levy to help fund residual claims, are inflexible. Costs are also rising for wilfully self-inflicted injuries, hearing loss, and rehabilitation.</text>

          <text>To retain the status quo would result in large ACC levy fluctuations, restrict the ability of ACC to restrain costs caused by extension of legislated entitlements, and would not achieve the Government policy to improve individual risk sharing.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Other cost-reduction measures are occurring at the same time, namely a review of ACC administration, claims handling, and purchasing costs. An example of one result of this review is the renegotiation of high-cost contracts with physiotherapists. ACC is also looking at regulating some payment rates that have previously been made under contract or paid on an ad hoc basis. ACC is also focused on improving its rehabilitation rates, particularly concentrating on long-term claimants.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Preferred option</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>There is no alternative to repealing or amending the current legislation for the proposals in the Bill revoking the 2008 amendments and making other changes to reduce costs and enhance collaboration across the health sector. These proposals collectively are estimated to generate savings of at least $65 million each year across levy accounts and the (Crown-funded) Non-Earners' Account.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The proposal to extend the date by which the Scheme must fully fund residual claims from 2014 to 2019 will improve affordability in the immediate term by spreading the costs over a longer time. This proposal can be effected by only legislative amendment.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Other proposed amendments are not about cost containment per se. These include the disestablishment of ministerial advisory committees that are no longer needed, and enabling provisions to allow Ministers to have flexibility in the way residual claims are funded and to improve application of an ACC levy.

        <para>
          <text>Concerns raised have been included in the Cabinet paper, and individual agencies have made separate comments in that paper.

        <para>
          <text>The only proposal for which flow-on costs have been estimated is the change to the threshold for hearing loss cover.

This is considerably less than what ACC has been paying.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Other areas where costs to the Health and Social Welfare budgets might occur but have not yet been estimated are in supporting workers who are on low weekly compensation, supporting families of people who commit suicide who may require benefit support and a funeral benefit, and ongoing support of people seriously injured as a result of a wilfully self-inflicted injury (about 4 claimants each year). Te Puni Kōkiri also expressed a view that a number of the amendments would particularly affect Maori, including those reducing weekly compensation and the <quote.in quote="1">repugnant to justice</quote.in> amendment.</text>
