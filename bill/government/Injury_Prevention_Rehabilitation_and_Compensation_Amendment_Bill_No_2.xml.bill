        <para>
          <text>The overall purpose of this Bill is to continue the Government’s commitment to a fair and sustainable ACC scheme for reducing the incidence and impact of personal injury, by proposing amendments to cover for work-related injuries, changes in weekly compensation eligibility and entitlement, and changes in entitlement and processes around vocational rehabilitation and independence. The Bill also includes a number of other issues that arise out of ongoing policy development, and also some technical changes.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Work-related gradual process, disease, and infection</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001 (the <emphasis style="bold">Act</emphasis>), work-related gradual process, disease, or infection is covered if it meets specific criteria. First, there must be a personal injury as defined in section 26. Second, a causal link must be established between the personal injury and the person’s employment. Some diseases receive cover under Schedule 2, which provides a streamlined cover process for diseases with a strong link to occupation. However, the majority of work-related gradual process, disease, or infection claims must meet the three-part test of causation set out in section 30(2) of the Act before being covered.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Ministerial Advisory Panel on Work-Related Gradual Process, Disease, or Infection highlighted the three-part test as a barrier for cover for claimants with a work-related gradual process, disease, or infection. The Panel noted that the burden of proof rested with the claimant, and could be hard to meet.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>As a result of the Panel’s report, the Government committed to making changes to ensure that people harmed by their work receive greater access to cover and more clarity around whether cover was available and how it was determined.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill revises the three-part test of causation set out in section 30(2) of the Act, to provide greater certainty of cover for claimants with a work-related gradual process, disease, or infection.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill also makes changes to provide greater flexibility to amend Schedule 2, and extends eligibility for lump sum compensation.</text>

              <para>
                <text>the three-part test is amended to clarify the threshold of allowable non-work exposure. Under this change, if a person has both work and non-work exposure to the cause of the injury, the person will receive cover if the work exposure was the more likely cause:</text>

            <item>

              <para>
                <text>the section is amended so that if a person otherwise meets the requirements of section 30(2), a claim could be declined only if ACC proves that the work task or work environment places the claimant at no significantly greater risk of developing that personal injury.</text>

        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Improving the flexibility of section 30(3) and Schedule 2</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill provides that descriptions of personal injury caused by work-related gradual process, disease, or infection for the purposes of section 30(3) can include personal injury caused by employment in certain occupations, industries, or processes, or personal injury caused by a specified level of extent of occupational exposure to a harmful agent. This provides greater flexibility in terms of adding new work-related gradual processes, diseases, or infections to Schedule 2.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Extending lump sum eligibility to pre-1 April 2002 work-related gradual process, disease, or infection claims</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Clause 55 of Schedule 1 of the Act denies eligibility for lump sum compensation for claimants who suffer personal injury caused by work-related gradual process, disease, or infection following 1 April 2002, but whose last exposure to the relevant agent or environment, first treatment, or incapacity was before that date. These claimants would receive an independence allowance instead of lump sum compensation. The case of <emphasis style="italic">Estate of Priddle and Others v ACC</emphasis> required ACC to provide lump sum compensation to claimants whose eligibility is determined under Schedule 2, and whose deemed date of injury was on or after 1 April 2002, even though their injury was caused by exposure that took place prior to that date.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>An amendment is now required to ensure fairness between groups of claimants. The Bill provides entitlement to lump sum compensation to both Schedule 2 claimants and claimants whose eligibility for cover for work-related gradual process, disease, or infection is established through the three-part test in section 30(2). Claimants who suffered personal injury before the date the amendment comes into force (other than Schedule 2 claimants) will continue to be subject to the limitation in clause 55(2). However, those who suffer personal injury following the date the Bill comes into force will be entitled to lump sum compensation. The Bill also allows this group of claimants to elect between receiving an independence allowance or lump sum compensation to ensure those claimants are not disadvantaged. Should their level of impairment be reassessed, they will be able to re-elect to receive lump sum compensation if they previously chose to receive an independence allowance.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Cover for mental injury arising from traumatic events in workplace</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Act covers mental injury in 2 situations: mental injury suffered because of the claimant’s physical injuries, and mental injury suffered as a result of certain types of sexual abuse or assault. No cover is currently available for mental injury caused by exposure to a sudden traumatic event in the course of employment (for example, witnessing a colleague shot in a bank robbery, or a train driver hitting someone on the tracks).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Experiencing an extreme traumatic event affects people in different ways. Most will deal with the event in their own way, and with no longer-term consequences. However, some people develop severe, longer-term mental/psychological problems that impact on their ability to function in everyday life. The Bill aims to ensure that these people are covered by the scheme in the same way that others physically harmed in the workplace are covered.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill introduces cover for mental injury caused by exposure to a sudden traumatic event in the course of employment. This provides cover for clinically significant mental injuries, rather than temporary distress that constitutes a normal reaction to trauma. The event must be seen, heard, or experienced by the person directly (and not, for example, seen on television), and be one which could reasonably be expected to cause mental injury. It does not introduce cover for mental injury caused by non-physical stress (gradual onset) in the workplace. Providing cover will help to ensure appropriate treatment, and will facilitate rehabilitation, including an early and sustainable return to work.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Key changes to eligibility and entitlement provisions for weekly compensation</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>In general, weekly compensation is paid to eligible claimants at 80% of pre-injury earnings, and is intended to provide earnings-related compensation so that claimants can meet their everyday expenses and focus on recovery.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A review of the provisions for weekly compensation was undertaken in response to concerns that some seasonal and casual workers are disadvantaged by the current rules for calculating weekly compensation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The review found that the rules for assessing weekly compensation continue to meet the needs of people in standard work. However, nearly a quarter of today’s workforce is in non-standard work. They may be in part-time work, self-employment, undertake casual or seasonal work, or regularly move in and out of employment.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill updates the weekly compensation framework by improving access to weekly compensation (particularly for seasonal and casual workers), making the assessment for claimants easier to understand, allowing earlier access to minimum weekly compensation, and increasing the rate of weekly compensation paid to potential earners. The Bill also improves weekly compensation for seasonal workers who are incapacitated for more than 5 weeks.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Lengthening extended employee status</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Currently, most claimants are not eligible for weekly compensation if they are between jobs or on unpaid leave and are injured more than 14 days after stopping work. The Bill extends eligibility for weekly compensation for these claimants to 28 days after stopping work. The proposal reduces uncertainty for the majority of people who are injured between jobs.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Providing extended earner status to self-employed persons and shareholder employees</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Employees are currently eligible for weekly compensation if they are injured within 14 days of ceasing paid employment. The Act does not, however, allow access to weekly compensation for people who are injured in a period between moving from a self-employed, or a shareholder-employee, position to employment as an employee. The Bill allows extended earner status to apply to self-employed people and shareholder-employees who are injured during a transition to employment as an employee. The Bill also allows the extended 28 day period to apply to these people.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Fairer and more straightforward weekly compensation for seasonal and casual employees</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Act currently assesses non-permanent employee income against a period that includes both earning and non-earning periods. This results in a significant reduction of income for a number of seasonal or casual employees who receive weekly compensation for more than 4 weeks. The Bill addresses this issue by changing the way that weekly compensation is calculated. For short-term compensation, claimants’ earnings (from employment held at the date of incapacity) in the 4 weeks before the incapacity will be divided by the full and part weeks worked in that period. For long-term compensation, claimants’ earnings (from employment held at the date of incapacity) in the 52 weeks before the incapacity will be divided by the full and part weeks worked during that period.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Improved abatement conditions for partially incapacitated people who return to work part-time</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Under the current Act, people who return to work part-time have their weekly compensation abated at the rate of 24 cents for every $1 of earnings above $67.24 per week, and 56 cents for every $1 of earnings above $107.52 per week. The total of claimants’ earnings from employment and weekly compensation cannot be more than their weekly earnings as calculated under the Act. The provisions for abatement are complicated and can potentially discourage claimants from returning to work. The Bill provides that claimants are able to earn up to 100% of their weekly earnings (as calculated under the Act) before weekly compensation is abated and that, as per the status quo, abatement is dollar for dollar above that level.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Improving fairness for abatement of leave provisions for weekly compensation, where leave payment is made on termination</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill provides that any payment made at the end of a person’s employment (that is employment held at the time of incapacity) in respect of leave entitlements would not be considered earnings for the purposes of abating weekly compensation. This means that ACC would not reduce claimants’ weekly compensation over the equivalent period that they were paid leave entitlements after their employment ended.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Increases for people receiving minimum weekly compensation after first week of incapacity</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>At present, people who work full-time and earn less than the minimum weekly earnings (as determined under the Act) are eligible to increase their weekly compensation to the minimum weekly compensation amount only after the first 5 weeks of incapacity. Claimants in this group often receive less than the minimum weekly compensation amount for the first 5 weeks of incapacity, which can pose financial difficulty for these people. The Bill provides that full-time employees will be eligible for the minimum weekly compensation amount after the first week of incapacity.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Increases in loss of potential earnings compensation for young people</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>In certain circumstances, ACC pays weekly compensation for loss of potential earnings (<emphasis style="bold">LOPE</emphasis>) to people aged 18 years or older if they have an incapacity from a personal injury suffered when they were under 18 years or when they were in full-time study that started before they turned 18 years. The rate of LOPE compensation is 80% of the minimum weekly earnings (as determined under the Act). The minimum weekly earnings are determined under the Act as being the greater of the minimum wage or 125% of the Invalid’s Benefit. Currently, the level of compensation does not adequately reflect an average life-long pattern of earnings. The Bill provides that weekly compensation for loss of potential earnings will be 100% of the minimum weekly earnings (as determined under the Act).</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Definition of full-time study for eligibility for LOPE compensation</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>ACC pays LOPE compensation to claimants who meet particular conditions, one being that they are not engaged in full-time study or training during the period of their incapacity. The current definition of full-time study is <amend.in quote="1">a course of study recognised as full-time by the place of education that administers it</amend.in>. This could be interpreted to exclude from LOPE compensation seriously injured claimants who undertake full-time courses to gain life skills.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill clarifies the definition of full-time study for the purposes of eligibility to LOPE so that seriously injured claimants, otherwise eligible for LOPE payments, can receive compensation while they are enrolled in full-time courses for the purpose of gaining independent living and social skills (as opposed to NZQA approved vocational qualifications). Undertaking full-time study that is aimed at social, rather than vocational, rehabilitation outcomes does not make a claimant ineligible for LOPE.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Interim estimation of weekly earnings for self-employed persons and shareholder-employees</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Clause 45 of Schedule 1 of the Act provides that ACC can estimate an amount that represents reasonable remuneration for a claimant who had earnings as a self-employed person or shareholder-employee in certain situations when it cannot readily ascertain the claimant’s actual weekly earnings. However, the Act does not allow ACC to estimate weekly earnings for self-employed claimants who had earnings as a self-employed person immediately before their incapacity and had earnings as a shareholder-employee in the relevant year, and vice versa; that is, self-employed or shareholder-employee claimants who have changed their employment status. The Bill remedies this situation.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Clarifying cessation of weekly compensation for surviving spouses</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Clause 66(5)(c) of Schedule 1 is intended to relate to situations where a surviving spouse or partner is caring for the youngest child of the deceased and the child turns 18. It is currently not clear that the surviving spouse or partner cannot continue to receive spousal weekly compensation if the child is no longer in their care. The Bill clarifies this.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Enabling aggregation of weekly compensation payable to surviving spouses</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Surviving spouses and partners to whom weekly compensation is payable under the 1992 and subsequent legislation can choose to aggregate their compensation payments; whereas aggregation is not permissible for those whose spousal weekly compensation is payable under earlier legislation. The Bill allows spouses and partners to whom weekly compensation is payable under the 1972 and 1982 legislation to choose to receive their compensation as 1 or more aggregated payments.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Clarification of limit on calculation of weekly compensation for self-employed persons and shareholder-employees with previous earnings as employees</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill amends clauses 38 and 39 of Schedule 1 of the Act to clarify that in relation to any self-employed/shareholder-employee claims accepted before 1 July 2005 and then resubmitted after that date, recalculated payments of weekly compensation will only be backdated to 1 July 2005.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Maintaining minimum weekly compensation for claimants who are eligible under 1972 and 1982 legislation</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill clarifies that section 366 of the Act only applies to claimants who had minimum weekly compensation established under the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or the Accident Insurance Act 1998. This maintains the policy intent of allowing claimants to maintain their rate of weekly compensation where it has been established under the 1972 and 1982 Accident Compensation Acts.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Enabling people to purchase TimeOut cover for periods less than 3 months</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Section 223 of the Act provides that, in certain circumstances, weekly compensation can be purchased for periods during which people take unpaid leave or are otherwise outside employment (TimeOut cover). However, TimeOut can only be purchased for periods outside employment that are longer than 3 months. The Bill enables people to purchase weekly compensation for periods outside employment of less than 3 months.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Key changes to provisions for vocational rehabilitation and independence</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The ACC scheme entitles some claimants who are injured to vocational rehabilitation, for the purposes of restoring the claimant to employment or employability as far as practicable. Recent research and evaluation has indicated that the framework for vocational rehabilitation for claimants could be enhanced to provide better outcomes.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Discretionary extension of the three-year limit on vocational rehabilitation</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>At present, claimants are only eligible for a maximum of 3 years in total of vocational rehabilitation. There are some claimants who need more vocational rehabilitation such as those who are seriously injured and need ongoing assistance to stay in the work force. The Bill provides ACC with discretion to extend the 3-year limit on vocational rehabilitation, where appropriate.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Removal of the upper age limit for vocational rehabilitation</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Vocational rehabilitation is currently linked to weekly compensation. Entitlement to weekly compensation is affected by the qualifying age for New Zealand superannuation. The Bill removes the upper age limit so that eligibility for vocational rehabilitation continues despite the transitional arrangements between weekly compensation and superannuation. Eligibility for vocational rehabilitation will not be affected by loss of entitlement to weekly compensation, if the reason for the loss of entitlement is that claimants have reached, or are over, the qualifying age for New Zealand superannuation. Additional vocational rehabilitation can be delivered where this is appropriate to return claimants aged at or over the New Zealand superannuation qualification age to work.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Requirement for occupational assessors to take into account pre-incapacity earnings</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Occupational assessors are not currently obliged to take into account a claimant’s pre-injury earnings during any occupational assessment. The Bill requires occupational assessors to consider a claimant’s pre-incapacity earnings when identifying suitable work-types in occupational assessments. This will help to ensure that jobs identified for claimants during assessments reflect a claimant’s previous earnings, where this is possible.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Key changes for other policy issues</explnote.subhead1>
        <explnote.subhead2>Repeal of disentitlements for wilfully self-inflicted injuries</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Section 119 of the Act prohibits ACC from providing entitlements (other than treatment) for wilfully self-inflicted personal injury and suicide, unless the personal injury or death is a result of mental injury. This restriction creates a lack of transparency and certainty for claimants and surviving family members about whether they will receive cover. Research indicates that the vast majority of suicidal behaviour and wilfully self-inflicted injury is associated with having a mental health disorder, and having further proof of mental injury adds little value to the determination of cover. The Bill repeals section 119 so that ACC can provide entitlements to claimants who suffer wilfully self-inflicted injury on or after the date that the amendment comes into effect.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Eligibility of nurse practitioners to determine incapacity and undertake assessment for ACC purposes</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Currently, only registered medical practitioners (doctors) and registered medical specialists perform certain functions under the Act because these tasks require a minimum level of medical qualification and experience. Nurse practitioners are sufficiently qualified and experienced to deliver some treatments previously considered the sole purview of doctors. The Bill allows the date of treatment by a nurse practitioner to be considered as the date on which a person suffers a personal injury caused by a work-related gradual process, disease, or infection. The Bill also requires ACC to consider assessments undertaken by nurse practitioners when determining incapacity for employment.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Establishing a mechanism for review of regulated treatment cost entitlements</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Currently, the Act does not provide for a regular review of treatment cost amounts. The Bill provides for a mechanism to require an annual review of the amounts ACC is liable to pay treatment providers under regulations for the purpose of assessing whether an adjustment is necessary to take into account changes in treatment costs. The Bill also amends section 324(2) to allow consultation on proposed treatment costs regulations to be at the Minister’s discretion, having regard to the subject matter of the proposed changes.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Due date for levy payment</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Act currently states that the due date for self-employed, employers, and private domestic workers to pay their levy invoice cannot be less than 2 months after the invoice date. ACC must calculate and apply interest to any unpaid levy from the day after the date that payment is due. The Bill allows the due date for levy payments to be 1 month from the invoice date, rather than the current 2 months, while retaining the existing time frames for interest and penalties.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Ancillary powers of ACC</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Section 265 of the Act allows ACC to provide services in addition to those that would normally be provided if those services are provided in a manner consistent with ACC’s role and function. The Bill amends section 265 to clarify that it allows a subsidiary of ACC to provide services outside ACC’s core functions, in situations where the services are consistent with the Act’s purposes, and to provide the services to a person who would not otherwise be covered by the Act.</text>

Some diseases receive cover under Schedule 2, which provides a streamlined cover process for diseases with a strong link to occupation. However, the majority of work-related gradual process, disease, or infection claims must meet the three-step test of causation set out in section 30(2) of the Act before being covered.

          <text>The first package improved access and assessment, while retaining the remaining features of the weekly compensation framework. The full-funded cost per year of the package was between $6.1 million and $9.1 million. This package addressed the 2 issues that instigated the review: access to compensation for claimants injured while not working and under-compensation for non-permanent employees (ie, seasonal or casual workers). However, the package did not make the assessment easier for claimants to understand. Therefore, this option was not favoured.</text>

          <text>The second package was a comprehensive package of options that dealt with all the issues through legislative change. The indicative full-funded cost per year of the package was between $63 million and $138.6 million. The comprehensive package had the highest overall net benefits compared to the other options, given that it addressed all the issues identified in the most comprehensive fashion. However, a number of the proposals went beyond what could be considered reasonable compensation, which could create disincentives for returning to work. The magnitude of the proposals resulted in a package that was 3 times more expensive than the next option, which would have a significant impact on ACC levies. Therefore, the option was not favoured.</text>

                <text>improving access to weekly compensation for people who are injured while temporarily between jobs: employees are currently eligible for weekly compensation if they are injured within 14 days of leaving paid employment and had arranged future work as an employee. The Act does not, however, allow access to weekly compensation for people who are injured in a period between moving from a self-employed, or a shareholder-employee, position to employment as an employee. The proposal extends the period of eligibility after leaving employment to 28 days and also allows self-employed people and shareholder-employees who are injured during a transition to employment as an employee to be eligible in the same way as employees. This addresses the issue of uncertainty for the majority of people who are between jobs:</text>

                <text>fairer and more straightforward weekly compensation for seasonal and casual employees: after the first 5 weeks of incapacity, compensation for non-permanent employees (eg, seasonal workers) is assessed against periods of earnings and non-earnings. Under this approach, some employees may receive compensation that does not reflect their lost earnings. To ensure that all claimants receive weekly compensation that is reflective of their lost earnings and is easily understood, it is proposed that the way that weekly compensation is calculated be changed. For short-term compensation, claimants’ earnings (from employment held at the date of incapacity) in the 4 weeks before the incapacity will be divided by the full and part weeks worked in that period. For long-term compensation, claimants’ earnings in the 52 weeks (from employment held at the date of incapacity) before the incapacity will be divided by the full and part weeks worked during that period:</text>

A revised abatement regime is proposed, in which claimants are able to earn up to 100% of their weekly earnings (as calculated under the Act) before weekly compensation is abated and that, as per the status quo, abatement is dollar for dollar above that level. This assessment provides a greater incentive for claimants to make an initial return to work as well as making the assessment easier to understand:</text>

Weekly compensation is based on the greater of the minimum wage or 125% of the invalid’s benefit, and is payable at 80% of the greater rate. Currently, the level of compensation does not adequately reflect an average life-long pattern of earnings. As a step towards acknowledging a person’s real potential earnings, this option allows eligible claimants to receive weekly compensation at 100% of the greater of the minimum wage or 125% of the invalid’s benefit.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The ACC scheme entitles certain claimants who are incapacitated to vocational rehabilitation in order to restore the claimant to employability as far as practicable.

        <para>
          <text>To ensure that injured people are restored to employability as far as practicable and are able to contribute to the economy. A secondary objective is to ensure that the vocational rehabilitation provisions in the Act are sufficiently flexible to allow ACC to deliver the most appropriate rehabilitation in most cases.</text>

          <emphasis style="italic">Three-year limit</emphasis>
        </explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>At present claimants are only eligible for a maximum of 3 years in total of vocational rehabilitation. There are some claimants who need more vocational rehabilitation such as those who are seriously injured and need ongoing assistance to stay in the work force.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Two other options were identified. The first was removal of the maximum time limit. This was not pursued as it risked unnecessary vocational rehabilitation being given with a potential high cost. The second option was removal of the maximum time limit for claimants who meet specific criteria. This was not pursued as it was likely to be of a high cost and might not capture all claimants.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>
          <emphasis style="italic">Upper age limit</emphasis>
        </explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Vocational rehabilitation is currently linked to weekly compensation. Entitlement to weekly compensation is affected by the transitional arrangements between weekly compensation and New Zealand superannuation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Two other options were identified. The first was simplified transitional arrangements to allow people over 65 to have at least 2 years of vocational rehabilitation. This was not pursued because it does not address limits to vocational rehabilitation for people affected by the transitional arrangements. The second option, providing a discretionary extension of the eligibility period, was not considered suitable because of the increased complexity and associated risks.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>
          <emphasis style="italic">Pre-incapacity earnings</emphasis>

        <para>
          <text>Occupational assessors are not currently obliged to take into account a claimant’s pre-incapacity earnings during any occupational assessment.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Two other options were identified. The first, maintaining the current provisions with operational changes, was not pursued because it would not provide a clear legislative requirement and assessors might not consider the pre-incapacity earnings. The second option was a legislative amendment providing that the Occupational Assessor could consider pre-injury earnings if appropriate. This option was not pursued as it did not place a requirement on assessors and would be likely to result in a higher risk of reviews and appeals.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Discretionary extension of the 3-year limit on vocational rehabilitation</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill provides ACC with discretion to extend the 3-year limit on vocational rehabilitation, where appropriate.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Removal of upper age limit for vocational rehabilitation</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill removes the upper age limit so that eligibility for vocational rehabilitation may continue despite the transitional arrangements between weekly compensation and superannuation. Eligibility for vocational rehabilitation will not be affected by loss of entitlement to weekly compensation if the reason for the loss of entitlement is that claimants have reached, or are over, the qualifying age for New Zealand superannuation. Additional vocational rehabilitation can be delivered where this is appropriate to return claimants aged at or over the New Zealand superannuation qualification age to work.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Requirement for occupational assessors to take into account pre-incapacity earnings</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill requires that occupational assessors consider a claimant’s pre-incapacity earnings when identifying suitable work-types in occupational assessments. This will help to ensure that jobs identified for claimants during assessments reflect a claimant’s previous earnings, where this is possible.</text>

          <emphasis style="italic">Costs and benefits</emphasis>
        </explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The policies mostly contributing to the cost increases are the 3-year limit and the upper age limit. The estimated central cost for the 3-year limit policy is $1,721,127 (excluding GST). The estimated central cost for the upper age limit policy is $1,170,572 (excluding GST). It is expected that most costs for these proposals will be met from ACC levies (with most costs being met from the Earners’ and Work Accounts, and smaller impacts on the Motor Vehicle and Residual Claims Accounts). There are small costs attributed to the Non-Earners’ Account for potential earners, and an increase in appropriations of approximately $25,000 (for 2008/09) is required. The costs for the earnings rate proposal are minimal.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The proposals will allow ACC greater flexibility to deliver appropriate rehabilitation and help to ensure that injured people are restored to employment or employability.</text>
