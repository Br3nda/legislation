                <para>
                  <text>for gifts between 2 and 5 years, the onus of proof will no longer lie with the OA (to prove that the debtor was unable to pay his or her debts (the <def-term id="DLM1832119">solvency test</def-term>)). It will shift to the recipient of the gift: </text>

                  <text>when proving solvency, account will again be taken of debts that have not yet fallen due, for example, contingent liabilities. The 2006 Act provides that the solvency test looks only at due debts. </text>

            <text>The amendments do not alter the need for the OA to prove that a gift took place. For example, a debtor may pay money into a bank account that intermingles personal and family trust funds for the benefit of a trust but, if it is not a gift, it will not be voidable (<emphasis style="italic">see</emphasis>, for example, <emphasis style="italic">Robertson (As Trustee of the G &amp; A Fisher Family Trust) v the Official Assignee </emphasis>CA 587/2007 [2008] NZCA 500). Gift was defined in the 1967 Act to mean  any disposition made otherwise than in good faith and for valuable consideration. There is no definition in the 2006 Act.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The insolvent gift rules apply only to bankrupts. They do not apply to persons in the no asset procedure (<emphasis style="bold">NAP</emphasis>), which is a similar procedure designed for debtors with debts of less than $40,000. However, a person is disqualified from the NAP if the OA is satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that the debtor has concealed assets with the intention of defrauding his or her creditors, for example, by transferring property to a trust (<emphasis style="italic">see</emphasis> section 364(a) of the 2006 Act). So, if the OA believes that a person has entered the NAP after having made an insolvent gift, the OA may be able to terminate the NAP if the OA has <quote.in quote="1">reasonable grounds to be satisfied that the debtor has concealed assets with the intention of defrauding his or her creditors</quote.in>. </text>

But many debts with a statutory base are not cancelled, for example, fines, penalties, sentences of reparation, amounts owing under maintenance orders under the Family Proceedings Act 1980, and amounts owing in respect of the child support scheme. The main differences left between the NAP and bankruptcy are in respect of student loan debts and judgment debts. </text>

If a debtor has had their details removed from the public register, then the OA must put the details back if the debtor has had multiple bankruptcy events. This means that the OA will have to search the OA's internal register, after Royal assent, to find debtors who have had multiple bankruptcy events, and either reinstate their details to the public register or, in the case of pre-2006 Act bankruptcies, ensure that the public register contains information about these debtors.</text>

          <text>The law currently provides that all people admitted to the NAP must be discharged after 12 months of entering the NAP. Unlike bankruptcy, the OA does not have the ability to extend the period of discharge to properly investigate any late information relating to a debtor's termination from NAP (including creditors' objections) that is received from creditors and other interested parties. This prevents the OA from undertaking a thorough investigation, thereby undermining the natural justice process which the OA is required to adhere to under the Act.</text>

          <text>The insolvent transaction provisions in the Act were amended as part of the overall insolvency reform in 2006 to promote consistency with the voidable transaction provisions in the Companies Act 1993 and, further, to reflect a modern and simple drafting style. The Act currently provides that any gifts made in the 2-year period prior to the adjudication of the debtor are presumed to be void, but this presumption is rebuttable if it is proven that the debtor was solvent at the time of making the gift. The law also provides that any gifts made by the debtor in the 2–5 year period prior to adjudication can be made void, but the OA has to prove that the debtor was insolvent at the time of making the gift.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The amendments made have inadvertently weakened the voidable gifts provisions under the Act and imposed an administrative burden on the OA. These have a negative impact on the returns to the creditors.</text>

          <text>The public register provisions in the Act record details of persons who have entered into NAP and bankruptcy for 1 year and 7 years respectively. The problem with these specified periods is that they do not allow future lenders or credit rating agencies access to information beyond these time frames in order to undertake a proper assessment of the creditworthiness of an individual.</text>

          <text>While this may be a good compromise between the insolvent gift provisions in the 1967 and 2006 Acts, it would be an expensive and time consuming option. Also, the recipient of the gift may not have the necessary funds to go to court to defend his or her interest in the gift.

However, there are safeguards in the Act (section 206 of the Act) to ensure that the gift is not clawed back from a recipient who has acted in good faith, had no reason to suspect that the donor was insolvent, and has altered his or her position in reliance on the gift. The OA, as a matter of practice, writes to the recipients requesting them to demonstrate why it is not an insolvent gift under section 208. This is done to prevent the OA cancelling a gift that the court may reinstate if the recipient is able to satisfy the requirements under section 208 of the Act.</text>

        <para>
          <text>This is not a viable option as creditors would have to incur a transaction cost to obtain this information from the credit reporting agencies. This would mean an additional cost for the creditors. Further, the Credit Reporting Privacy Code 2004 prohibits the credit reporting agencies from keeping the information on bankruptcy for more then 7 years, so it is unlikely that this information will be accessed by any prospective lender beyond that period.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Another option would be to permanently retain a debtor's details concerning the NAP and first time bankruptcy on the respective public registers. While this would provide future lenders unlimited and free access to the public register, and enable them to better assess the creditworthiness of an individual, it does not promote the fundamental rehabilitative principles that underpin personal bankruptcy laws. This option goes to the extreme of permanently disqualifying an individual who has entered bankruptcy as a result of a long-term illness or a marriage break-up. In these circumstances, an individual deserves a second chance but this option deprives them of this opportunity indefinitely.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Adopting this option would also create inconsistencies with the Credit Reporting Privacy Code 2004. This code prohibits credit reporting agencies from keeping the information on bankruptcy for more than 7 years. This Code has its legal basis in the Privacy Act 1993.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Increasing the time for the availability of NAP debtors' details on the register aligns the NAP public register provisions with the bankruptcy register provisions in the Act, ie, the information is provided for 4 more years after a debtor is discharged from these processes.</text>

          <text>The fundamental principle of rehabilitation that underpins personal insolvency law is also preserved as only those individuals who have entered into an insolvency process for a second time would have their names on the public registers permanently.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Extending the period of time for a debtor's details to be on the NAP public register may dilute the main objectives of providing debtors with a fresh start in life after being in the NAP process for 1 year and avoiding the stigma that is commonly associated with bankruptcy. Having their details of entry to the NAP on the public register for 4 more years after discharge (ie, a total of 5 years) could deprive an individual access to credit that they might otherwise have if their names were not publicised for such a length of time.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Office of the Privacy Commissioner is concerned that a discharged debtor could be refused credit to obtain basic necessities, such as telephone or power services as a result of their details being listed on their credit record. This would mean that debtors who have been through multiple insolvency processes are extremely unlikely to receive unsecured debt. The proposed extension of time for the details of debtors on the NAP and bankruptcy public registers is justified given the current economic climate where lenders ought to have as much information as possible to make prudent lending decisions and contribute to the flow of credit in the market.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is important to note that a fresh start and rebuilding of their financial lives for most debtors would begin once they have been accepted in the NAP process. Credit would still be extended to these debtors but the cost of credit would reflect their previous insolvency and credit history. This provides a balance to the NAP regime, which attracted some criticism during the reform process as being too debtor friendly. The rights of the creditor ought to prevail after a debtor has entered into a subsequent insolvency, as the bankrupt debtor has had a chance to a fresh start and in a lot of cases abused it.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The NAP debtors also avoid the stigma of bankruptcy as they do not have the <quote.in quote="1">bankrupt</quote.in> status to begin with, and are immune from the limits that are placed in bankruptcy, such as the limits on owning a business and travelling overseas.</text>
