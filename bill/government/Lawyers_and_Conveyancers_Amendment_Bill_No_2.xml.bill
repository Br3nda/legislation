          <text>The Justice and Electoral Committee has examined the Lawyers and Conveyancers Amendment Bill (No 2) and recommends that it be passed with the amendments shown.</text>

        <heading>Introduction</heading>
        <para>
          <text>The Lawyers and Conveyancers Amendment Bill (No 2) amends the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006, which has not yet come into force. At present, unions and employer organisations employ lawyers to provide legal services to their members. The Act provides explicitly that lawyers employed by unions and employer organisations will be guilty of misconduct if they provide such services. The purpose of this bill is to allow lawyers employed by unions and employer organisations to continue to provide legal services to their members.</text>

        <heading>Committee process</heading>
        <para>
          <text>The bill was referred to us on 25 June 2008, for report to the House by 10 July 2008. We were advised that the timeframe for our consideration of the bill was short because the Act is expected to come into force on 1 August 2008. The Government’s intention is to pass this amending legislation before that date.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Given the short time available for considering the bill, we sought a briefing from officials at our meeting on 26 June 2008, and decided to invite submissions from the three organisations that represent the main interests in this bill: Business New Zealand, the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, and the New Zealand Law Society. We heard evidence from these three organisations at our meeting on 3 July 2008.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In addition to these submissions, we received correspondence from the New Zealand College of Midwives, the New Zealand Educational Institute, and the New Zealand Nurses Organisation.</text>
        </para>
      </comm.lev1>
      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Issues raised by submitters</heading>
        <para>
          <text>Business New Zealand and the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions both support the bill. Both noted that the provision of legal services was essential to their role in assisting their members with advice, representation, and dispute resolution services, particularly in relation to employment matters. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The New Zealand Law Society does not support the bill, arguing that it is inconsistent with the consumer protection provisions of the Act, could create conflicts between employed lawyers’ duties to their employers and to their clients, raises issues about income sharing, and is unnecessary as a person representing an employer or employee in proceedings before the Employment Relations Authority or Employment Court does not have to be a lawyer. The society told us that it believes the current law does not allow unions and employer associations to provide legal services. The society is also concerned that the bill could create a precedent, encouraging others to seek further exceptions.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In addition to these submissions, the New Zealand College of Midwives approached us seeking coverage in the bill. The college provides professional indemnity insurance for individual midwives, and employs a lawyer to manage such cases on their behalf. The college is concerned that if it can no longer provide this service, the costs of indemnity insurance would be too high for many midwives to afford.</text>
        </para>
      </comm.lev1>
      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Committee consideration</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We considered carefully the issues raised by the submitters. We also asked our advisers for a summary of the non-legislative ways that lawyers employed by employer organisations and unions could adapt their current practice so that they could continue giving legal advice to union or organisation members under the Act. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We agreed with the New Zealand College of Midwives that organisations such as theirs should be included in the coverage of this bill. We therefore recommend that health professional organisations be included in the bill. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The New Zealand Law Society also proposed an amendment to section 107 of the Act. The proposed amendment was outside the scope of the bill, but we expect the Ministry of Justice to consider this issue carefully, and propose a legislative amendment if this is required.</text>
        </para>
      </comm.lev1>
      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Conclusion</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We consider that the bill should proceed, to ensure the organisations covered by it can continue to provide legal services to their members. We believe our recommended amendment will assist in achieving this aim.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>New Zealand National members noted that they might wish to introduce a Supplementary Order Paper at the committee of the whole House stage of the bill if, after careful consideration of matters raised in oral submissions to the committee, they consider there are further matters to be addressed.</text>
