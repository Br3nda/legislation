          <text>Ensuring that all workforce participants understand and can meet their employment obligations is key to a well-functioning labour market. Unions and employer associations provide a timely, practical, cost-effective, and relevant service that educates and supports people in meeting their obligations (including the provision of legal services). This amendment is designed to ensure that unions and employer associations can continue a long-standing practice of providing legal services to members of their organisations as part of the delivery of an integrated prevention and advice service connected with employment matters.</text>
