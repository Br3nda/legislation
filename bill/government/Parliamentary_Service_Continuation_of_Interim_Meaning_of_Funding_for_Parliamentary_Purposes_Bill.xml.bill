          <text>The Bill provides, until 31 December 2010, an interim meaning of the term “funding entitlements for parliamentary purposes” for the Parliamentary Service Act 2000. </text>

        <para>
          <text>Following the Controller and Auditor-General’s 2006 report on his inquiry into advertising expenditure incurred by the Parliamentary Service in the 3 months before the 2005 general election, legislation was needed to give clarity to the term.  The Bill provides an interim meaning of the term that is substantively the same as the interim meaning provided in the Appropriation (Continuation of Interim Meaning of Funding for Parliamentary Purposes) Act 2007, which expires on 1 July 2009.  A new interim meaning is needed to allow time for a permanent meaning of the term to be considered in the context of the Government's review of electoral finance and for any resulting legislation to be enacted.</text>
