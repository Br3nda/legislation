        <para>
          <text>A patent is a right granted over an invention. The grant of a patent gives the patent owner the exclusive right to make, use, and sell a patented invention. This right lasts for a maximum of 20 years from the date that the application was filed. Once the patent has expired anyone may use the invention. In return for the grant of this right, the patent owner must provide a detailed description of the invention. Patents in New Zealand are granted under the authority of the Commissioner of Patents (the <emphasis style="bold">Commissioner</emphasis>) after an examination process by the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (<emphasis style="bold">IPONZ</emphasis>).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The provision of this exclusive right is intended to provide inventors with an opportunity to make a return on their investment in innovation by preventing others from copying the invention. This provides an incentive for innovation and its dissemination that might not otherwise occur. The grant of patent rights also provides an incentive for foreign innovators to transfer their innovations to New Zealand. It is the benefits to society of this incentive effect that provide the main justification for the patent system.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Because the grant of a patent provides a form of monopoly right, the grant of patents can impose costs on society, particularly as most patents granted in New Zealand are granted to applicants from outside New Zealand. In order to minimise these costs and ensure that the patent system provides a net benefit to society, patents should only be granted for <quote.in quote="1">genuine innovations</quote.in>, that is, innovations that are new, involve an inventive step (ie, are non-obvious), and are useful.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>New Zealand’s current patent legislation, the Patents Act 1953, is modelled on the long since repealed United Kingdom Patents Act 1949. The standard of examination required under the Patents Act 1953 is relatively low compared with most other countries. Patent applications in New Zealand are only examined for adequacy of description and novelty. There is no examination for inventive step or usefulness, although lack of inventive step or usefulness are grounds on which third parties can oppose the grant of a patent or apply to revoke a granted patent. Novelty is determined on the basis of what is known or used in New Zealand—information available overseas, but not in New Zealand, is not considered when determining novelty. The courts have determined that, in the event of any dispute as to whether a patent should be granted, the Commissioner must give applicants the benefit of the doubt.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Most other countries examine for both novelty and inventive step, and many examine for usefulness as well. When considering novelty and inventive step, nearly all countries consider information made available anywhere in the world, and applicants are generally not given the benefit of the doubt in any dispute.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A consequence of this is that patent rights granted in New Zealand can be broader than patent rights granted in other countries for the same invention. This has the potential to disadvantage New Zealand businesses and consumers, as technology that may be freely available elsewhere could be covered by patents in New Zealand. Since much innovation is incremental, building on what has gone before, local innovators may be disadvantaged as well.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Patents Bill will replace the Patents Act 1953 and will update New Zealand’s patent regime to ensure that it continues to provide an appropriate balance between providing adequate incentives for innovation and technology transfer while ensuring that the interests of the public and the interests of Māori in their traditional knowledge and indigenous plants and animals are protected. It also updates the regulatory regime for patent attorneys.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The term <quote.in quote="1">manner of manufacture</quote.in> is carried over from the Patents Act 1953 and has been interpreted by the courts to exclude such things as <quote.in quote="1">products of nature</quote.in>, mere discoveries, mathematical algorithms, mere schemes or plans, and methods of medical treatment of humans.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill also requires that patent applications be examined for inventive step and usefulness before a patent can be granted. These criteria are not currently part of the patent examination process.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Under the Patents Act 1953, novelty and inventive step are determined with respect to what was known or used in New Zealand prior to the filing date of the patent application. No notice is taken of information available outside New Zealand. The Bill defines a <quote.in quote="1">prior art base</quote.in>, which is defined to be all information made available to the public in any form anywhere in the world. Novelty and inventive step are determined with respect to this <quote.in quote="1">prior art base</quote.in>. This will assist in reducing the risk that patents are granted in New Zealand for inventions that are otherwise known elsewhere and would not be eligible for patent protection in other countries.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>For an invention to meet the requirement to be useful, the Bill requires that inventions demonstrate specific, substantial, and credible utility. This requirement is intended to ensure that patents are granted only where the inventor has identified a real world use for the invention. Although all inventions must meet this requirement, it is of particular relevance for inventions involving genetic material where there have been instances of patents being granted for material where no specific use has been disclosed.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The courts have decided that, under the Patents Act 1953, the Commissioner should not refuse to grant a patent unless almost certain that no valid patent could be granted, and that applicants must be given the benefit of any doubt in any dispute. The benefit of the doubt requirement is stricter than the balance of probabilities approach taken by the courts. As a result, the Commissioner may be forced to grant patents that are likely to be held invalid by the courts. Such patents may give the patent owner rights they are not entitled to. Given the costs involved in challenging the grant of a patent, such patents may never be challenged. To deal with this problem, the Bill provides that the Commissioner must use the balance of probabilities approach.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Under the Bill, conflicts between applications that disclose similar inventions will be resolved by comparing the <quote.in quote="1">whole contents</quote.in> of the applications. This replaces the present, more limited, <quote.in quote="1">prior claiming</quote.in> approach.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A requirement of the patent system is that a full and complete disclosure of the invention be provided, sufficient to allow a suitably skilled person to replicate the invention. This can be difficult where the invention is, or involves, a micro-organism. In such cases, the Bill allows the disclosure requirements to be met by lodging a specimen of the micro-organism in a recognised depositary.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Disclosure of an invention prior to filing a patent application will destroy the novelty of the invention and prevent grant of a valid patent. There are occasions where inventors may disclose their inventions to third parties (eg, for the purpose of seeking investment capital) who later make the invention public without the inventor’s consent. In such circumstances it would be unfair to the inventors to deny them patent protection. The Bill provides that, in the event of unauthorised disclosure, a valid patent can still be obtained if a patent application is filed within 12 months of the disclosure.</text>

          <text>Although it is unlikely that patents including human beings in their scope would be granted under the current legislation, to remove any doubt, the Bill introduces a specific exclusion for human beings. This exclusion was recommended by the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification.</text>

Article 27.2 of the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement) requires that it is the commercial exploitation of the invention, rather than the nature of the invention itself, which must be objectionable. It is intended that this exclusion would be used infrequently, in relation to inventions where commercial exploitation is likely to be offensive to a significant section of the community, including Māori.</text>

          <text>The Bill will establish a Māori advisory committee to advise the Commissioner in relation to patent applications for inventions involving traditional knowledge or indigenous plants and animals. The committee’s function will be to provide advice that can be used by the Commissioner to determine whether such inventions are novel, or involve an inventive step, or whether the commercial exploitation of such inventions would be contrary to Māori values.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Challenging grant of patent</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>No matter how thorough the patent examination process is, patent examiners may not always be able to locate all information that might have a bearing on the decision to grant a patent. As a result some patents may be granted that should not have been granted. Such patents have the potential to impose unnecessary costs on consumers and businesses. The Bill introduces simplified procedures that will reduce the cost and complexity involved in challenging these patents.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A re-examination procedure is introduced that can be invoked at any time after a patent application is published. Any person may request re-examination, on the grounds that the invention concerned is not novel or lacks an inventive step.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The current administrative revocation procedure for revoking a granted patent will be expanded, so that it can be invoked by any person at any time after the grant of a patent (the current procedure is limited to the 12 months after grant). The application will be made to the Commissioner, who will make a decision after hearing the parties concerned if they so wish. This procedure is expected to be simpler and cheaper than the current requirement to apply to the High Court. As is currently the case, applicants for revocation will have the option of applying directly to the High Court.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>With the introduction of the procedures described above, the current pre-grant opposition procedure will be repealed. This procedure, which can only be invoked in a narrow 3-month window after acceptance of a patent application, can delay grant of a patent for some years. This can disadvantage patent owners, as a patent cannot be enforced until it is granted.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Procedural and administrative issues</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill replaces the current <quote.in quote="1">right to apply</quote.in> provisions with a <quote.in quote="1">right to grant</quote.in> regime. At present, only the inventors or their assignees may apply for a patent. This can cause problems for overseas applicants when rights to an invention are assigned and the assignment is not completed before the time limit for filing an application in New Zealand has expired. Due to differing requirements in other countries, the New Zealand application is often filed in the name of the assignee, who, at the time of filing, may not have the right to apply under New Zealand law. To overcome this problem, the Bill will provide that any person may apply for a patent, but only inventors and their assignees have the right to be granted the patent.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Currently, patent applications are published at acceptance, which may be 2 to 4 years after the initial application is made. The Bill provides that applications will be published at 18 months from their earliest priority date, in line with the policy of nearly all other countries. This will make little difference in practice, as most of the patent applications filed in New Zealand are also filed in other countries. This early publication of applications will reduce uncertainty for third parties regarding the scope of patent rights that may be granted.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>At present, all communications and other documents produced in connection with a patent application, with the exception of the patent specification, are not available for public inspection and are not subject to the provisions of the Official Information Act 1982. The Bill provides that, once an application has been accepted, all documents connected with an application will be made public. This brings New Zealand practice on this issue into line with the practice of most other countries.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Under the Patents Act 1953, applicants resident in New Zealand must seek permission from the Commissioner if they wish to file a patent application overseas and they have not already filed an application in New Zealand less than 6 weeks earlier. This provision was intended to allow the Commissioner to check whether such applications disclosed material that might be relevant for defence purposes. This imposes unnecessary costs and complexity on applicants, and in recent times permission has never been refused. Consequently, this provision is repealed by the Bill.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill will also allow the Commissioner to set time limits for applicants to respond to examination reports issued by the Commissioner. This will be in addition to the overall time limit for overcoming all objections that currently exist. Failure to meet the time limits will result in applications being deemed to be abandoned. This measure is intended to encourage applicants to prosecute their patent applications promptly, so that third parties who may be affected by the grant of a patent know the fate of patent applications as soon as possible.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill also makes a number of other changes of a minor nature to various procedural and administrative provisions of the Patents Act 1953, with a view to removing or updating obsolete provisions.

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Statement of policy objective</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>A patent provides the patent owner with an exclusive right to make, use, and sell an invention. In return for this exclusive right, the patent owner gives to society a new invention, which becomes available for all to use when the patent expires. The limited monopoly provided by the patent gives patent owners an opportunity to make a profit from their inventions and gain a return from their investment in innovation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The grant of this limited monopoly is justified on the grounds that the benefits to society as a whole, in terms of encouraging innovation and the disclosure of the invention, exceed the costs, such as increased prices and lessened competition. However, there will be a net benefit to society only if patents are granted for real innovations. If patents are granted for things that are not innovations then society is, in effect, granting a valuable property right without receiving something of comparable value in return.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>More than 90% of New Zealand patents are granted to overseas owners. If patent rights are granted that ought not to be granted, then much of the financial and social benefits of these patents may flow overseas, increasing the cost to New Zealand without corresponding benefits.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A key objective of the current review of the Patents Act 1953 is to, as far as possible, reduce the possibility that patents will be granted for things that are not innovations and, where such patents are granted, to make it easier and cheaper for the validity of such patents to be challenged.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Statement of problem and need for action</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The Patents Act 1953 is nearly 50 years old. It was based on the United Kingdom Patents Act 1949, and reflects practices and attitudes prevailing in the 1940s. The Patents Act 1953 is now out of step with international developments in patent law and practice, and there are doubts about its ability to meet the needs of New Zealand businesses in the twenty-first century. Other aspects of the Act are now superfluous in the light of other legislative changes since the Act was passed.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>To address the deficiencies of the Patents Act 1953, Cabinet, in August 2001, agreed to a 3-stage review of the Act. The proposals discussed in this regulatory impact statement are part of Stage 2 of this Review. Cabinet has previously agreed to proposals in Stage 1 (August 2001) and the first part of Stage 2 (September 2001). Contentious issues including Māori and other concerns regarding issues such as the patentability of biotechnological inventions, medical treatments, and computer software and business methods, will be dealt with in Stage 3 of the review.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The criteria for granting a patent contained in the Patents Act 1953 are less stringent than the criteria now applied in most other developed countries, including New Zealand’s major trading partners. This means that patents granted in New Zealand provide a broader monopoly than would be provided for the same invention in other countries. It also means that New Zealand is providing greater patent rights to overseas applicants than other countries would grant to New Zealand applicants. There is no economic advantage to New Zealand in doing this, and, potentially, there is a net economic cost to New Zealand given that more than 90% of patent owners are from overseas.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The procedures contained in the Patents Act 1953 for challenging the validity of a granted patent are complex and expensive. This, together with the inevitable uncertainty involved in taking legal action, may deter local businesses from challenging the validity of a patent, even where it is felt that a good case exists. This may mean that invalid patents, that is, patents that have been granted for things that are not innovations, may remain in force, with consequential costs to the economy in terms of higher prices and reduced competition.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The options available for achieving the desired objectives are limited by New Zealand’s obligations under the Paris Convention and the TRIPS agreement, which set out internationally agreed criteria for determining patentability. It is also desirable that New Zealand’s patent regime be aligned with those of other countries so as to simplify the requirements for those applicants who file applications in other countries.</text>

Currently there is no examination for inventive step, although lack of inventive step is a ground for opposition to grant, and revocation of, a patent.

              <para>
                <text>the introduction of examination for inventive step will reduce the risk that invalid patents will be granted, although this risk cannot be eliminated entirely.

                <text>examination for inventive step will also mean that those patents that are granted will be narrower in scope than those granted under the Patents Act 1953.

                <text>the relatively broad patent rights conferred due to the current absence of examination for inventive step may inhibit innovation by restricting the ideas that are available for others to use.

                <text>more than 90% of New Zealand patents are granted to overseas owners. The relatively broad patent rights conferred by the Patents Act 1953 means that much of the financial benefit of these patents will flow overseas. This effectively increases the costs of these patents to New Zealand without any corresponding benefit. Narrowing the scope of patents granted in New Zealand may reduce the cost of the patent system to New Zealand while retaining the benefits:</text>

The costs are ongoing rather than one-off and add to the cost of each patent application filed.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The increased costs to applicants will arise from 2 sources: the fees charged by IPONZ, and increases in legal costs to applicants, as follows:</text>

                <text>IPONZ operates on a cost recovery basis, that is, all costs are recovered from fees charged to patent applicants.

                <text>the introduction of examination for inventive step is likely to mean a greater amount of correspondence between patent examiners and applicants. As nearly all patent applicants use the services of a patent attorney, this will mean increased legal costs for applicants:</text>

                <text>the requirement for applicants to provide the Commissioner with all information that they are, or become, aware of that might have a bearing on the patentability of their inventions will also impose extra costs on applicants.

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>About 4 800 patent applications are filed in New Zealand each year. About 85% of applicants are from overseas, and will have filed patent applications in other countries. Most other countries impose requirements similar to those proposed above. Approximately half of those applicants who are resident in New Zealand will also file applications in other countries. For these applicants, any increase in costs is likely to be confined to any increase in fees charged by IPONZ, as they are in effect already having to comply with the proposed requirements. It is those applicants who only apply for patents in New Zealand who will be most affected by any cost increase associated with the proposals. Approximately 5% (240 per year) of New Zealand applicants file patent applications only in New Zealand.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>As noted above, the costs of the proposals are difficult to quantify, as the costs will vary from applicant to applicant. The cost to New Zealand applicants of obtaining a New Zealand patent is typically between $4,000 and $7,000, depending on the complexity of the application. Of this cost, between $300 and $400 (plus GST for New Zealand applicants) is made up of fees charged by IPONZ. The remainder is made up of fees charged by patent attorneys. Approximately one-quarter to one-third of the attorney’s charges will be incurred in dealing with objections made by patent examiners. The remainder arises from the preparation of the patent specification and any initial patentability search.</text>

        <para>
          <text>As noted above, the review of the Patents Act 1953 is being conducted in 3 stages, of which the proposals discussed in this statement are part of Stage 2. It will not be possible to estimate the net effect on compliance costs of changes to the Patents Act 1953 until the review has been completed. Any increase in costs to applicants as a result of the proposals detailed in this statement are estimated to be in the range of $100 to $1,000 per application for most New Zealand applicants.</text>

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Statement of nature and magnitude of problem and need for government action</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>In New Zealand, patents are granted under the Patents Act 1953 (the <emphasis style="bold">Act</emphasis>). The grant of a patent provides patent owners with the exclusive right to make, sell, and use their invention for a maximum period of 20 years from the date a patent application is filed. This provides an opportunity for innovators to make a return from their investment in research and development, and acts as an incentive to innovation. In return for the grant of a patent, patent owners must provide a full and complete description of their invention, which is made available to the public. Patents are granted after an examination process by the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (<emphasis style="bold">IPONZ</emphasis>).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Act’s definition of a patentable invention as <quote.in quote="1">any manner of new manufacture</quote.in> does not clearly define the requirements for a patentable invention. This can lead to uncertainty as to just what the requirements are, and just what subject matter is patentable, particularly in relation to new technologies. In addition, no other comparable country now has the same definition of invention, so that court decisions relating to the definition of invention from these countries are no longer useful as a guide to IPONZ or the New Zealand courts.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>IPONZ, when deciding whether or not to grant a patent, must give applicants the benefit of the doubt and can only refuse to grant a patent if it is <quote.in quote="1">practically certain</quote.in> that a court would find the patent invalid. As a result, patents that might be likely (but not almost certain) to be held invalid will be granted. The uncertainties and expense of challenging the validity of a patent mean that few patents are ever challenged. If patents are granted that the courts would find to be invalid, the rights enjoyed by patent owners are greater than they are entitled to. These greater rights have the potential to restrict competition and raise prices to consumers, and may restrict the activities of local businesses that lack the resources to challenge the validity of the patent.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The courts have interpreted the current definition of invention to exclude methods of medical treatment of humans from patent protection. This leads to uncertainty for both IPONZ and applicants over the patentability of these methods, as the courts may, in future, decide that they are patentable.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The proposed changes to the Patents Act 1953 will give greater certainty as to what is patentable subject matter. Because the definition of invention will be the same as that in Australia, inventions patentable in Australia will also be patentable in New Zealand and vice-versa. This will assist businesses in making decisions on whether or not they can obtain a patent, and hence on whether or not to invest in the development of a new product.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>If patents are only granted when, on the balance of probabilities, the criteria for patentability are met, there will be a much greater presumption that a granted patent is valid. This benefits both patent owners and third parties, as there would be greater certainty that a granted patent would be held to be valid by the courts. It would also reduce the likelihood that third parties will find that their access to existing technologies will be blocked by otherwise invalid patents.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The imposition of a stricter test for granting a patent may impose some extra costs on businesses applying for a New Zealand patent, due to more drawn-out arguments between patent applicants and patent examiners. It is likely, though, that the additional costs will reduce over time as both applicants and patent examiners become accustomed to the new requirements.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Government</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The proposed changes to the definition of invention are unlikely to impose additional costs or benefits upon the Government, as the new definition is not greatly different from the current one. The stricter test for granting a patent may lead to more drawn-out arguments between applicants and patent examiners. This could increase the time taken to examine patent applications and may impose some extra costs on IPONZ. It is not possible to quantify these costs, although they are likely to be small. As IPONZ operates on a cost recovery basis, any extra costs will be met from fees charged to patent applicants. Currently, the fees charged by IPONZ for the grant of a patent are in the range $300 to $400.</text>

        <para>
          <text>In New Zealand, patents are granted under the Patents Act 1953 (the <emphasis style="bold">Act</emphasis>). The grant of a patent provides patent owners with the exclusive right to make, sell, and use their invention for a maximum period of 20 years from the date a patent application is filed. This provides an opportunity for innovators to make a return from their investment in research and development, and acts as an incentive to innovation. In return for the grant of a patent, patent owners must provide a full and complete description of their invention, which is made available to the public. Patents are granted after an examination process by the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (<emphasis style="bold">IPONZ</emphasis>).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>At present, IPONZ will grant patents that include claims for plants and non-human animals if they meet the requirements for patent protection. The patenting of plants and animals raises ethical and social issues that are not encountered with non-living inventions. Many groups in society, including many Māori, are opposed to the granting of patents over plants and animals.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Plant varieties can be protected under both the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 and under the Patents Act 1953. (In this context, a plant means a particular species of plant, such as an apple. A plant variety is a particular variant of that plant species, such as the apple variety known as <quote.in quote="1">Fuji</quote.in>). Providing both patent protection and plant variety protection for the same variety is not consistent with New Zealand’s obligations under the 1978 Convention of the International Union for the Protection of New Plant Varieties (UPOV 78), to which New Zealand is a party.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Under the Patents Act 1953, an invention does not have to be useful to be granted a patent. The issue of usefulness has become an issue in relation to inventions involving genetic material, where some applicants have obtained patents for large numbers of genes without demonstrating any particular use for them. This means that those researchers who want to find a use for the genes will have to pay a royalty. This increases the cost of research and may discourage innovation in this area. The magnitude of the problem is not known, because although lack of usefulness is a ground for revocation of a granted patent, the costs and uncertainties involved in revoking a patent mean that patents are seldom challenged on this ground.</text>

          <text>The introduction of the morality exclusion may add to the costs of obtaining a patent where a patent is refused on these grounds. In the event of such a refusal, patent applicants may incur increased costs if they choose to dispute the refusal of the patent application, as further submissions would be required to convince the Commissioner to grant the patent. Since a patent will also be able to be revoked on these grounds, there may also be an increase in costs to patent owners in making submissions to the Commissioner or the courts in defending their patent. Objections, though, are likely to be relatively uncommon, affecting only those patents or patent applications in areas where there is likely to be strong opposition to the commercial use of the invention from a significant section of society.</text>

          <text>Making usefulness a criterion for granting a patent may impose additional costs on some patent applicants, particularly where their inventions involve genes or gene sequences. These costs may not be great though, as nearly all applicants in this field also apply for patents in jurisdictions (such as the United States and the European Union) that already impose this requirement. This proposal may reduce the number of excessively broad patents granted, particularly those involving genes or gene sequences. Although such patents may be held to be invalid by a court, there are significant costs and uncertainties involved in challenging their validity. The proposal will reduce the number of possibly invalid patents granted and reduce the costs imposed on researchers and businesses by these patents.</text>

Any cost increase would be recovered through the fees charged by IPONZ (currently $300 to $400 to grant a patent).

          <text>The Patents Act 1953 does not contain a specific research or experimental use exception. The New Zealand courts have ruled that research on a patented invention of an experimental nature would not infringe a patent, while research carried out with a commercial advantage in mind would. The case law, however, offers little guidance as to just where the distinction lies between experimental and commercial research. There is little guidance for researchers to enable them to determine whether research or experimental work that they might wish to conduct on a patented invention would be held to infringe a patent. The status of research work involving a patented invention in New Zealand is therefore uncertain.</text>

          <text>The Patents Act 1953 does not contain an experimental use exception. A review of the Patents Act 1953 has recently been completed, and a new Patents Bill to replace the Act has been drafted. The review did not deal with the issue of an experimental use exception. The question of whether or not use of patented inventions in research or experimental work constitutes patent infringement is determined by the courts on a case by case basis. While future court decisions may clarify the issue, there is no guarantee that this will happen. It is also possible that future decisions may have the effect of restricting the use in experiments of patented inventions, which is not desirable. Retaining the status quo is not considered adequate to achieve the public policy objectives.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Provide that the definition of <quote.in quote="1">exploitation</quote.in> does not include experimental use.

        <para>
          <text>Include an exception from infringement would be made for fair experimentation. The exception would include a non-exhaustive list of uses considered to be experimental uses together with guidelines on what constituted fair experimentation. This option provides greater clarity to researchers than the status quo, while providing the courts with flexibility. This flexibility, though, may lead to uncertainty, and the possibility that fair experimentation might be interpreted in a manner that restricts, rather than facilitates, the experimental use of patented inventions. Another problem is that the concept of fair experimentation may not adequately capture the requirements of Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Adoption of an experimental use exception may mean that some experimental uses of inventions that might currently be considered infringements would, in future, no longer be considered infringements. This has the potential to reduce the income of patent owners, and possibly reduce incentives for innovation. There is, however, little evidence that patent owners currently derive any significant income from experimental use of their inventions, so the exception is unlikely to have any negative effect on innovation. The provision of a specific experimental use exception is unlikely to have any significant negative effect on levels of investment in research and development in New Zealand. The effect is far more likely to be positive, although it is probably not possible to quantify the benefit.</text>

        <para>
          <text>There are some 350 registered patent attorneys in New Zealand, including around 240 Australians who are registered as a result of the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangements.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Concerns have arisen, from time to time, about the lack of a mechanism for the public to make complaints about the standards of service provided by patent attorneys. A number of respondents to the Ministry of Economic Development’s discussion paper entitled Review of the Regulatory Regime for the Patent Attorney Profession in New Zealand (published in October 2002) expressed dissatisfaction with the current disciplinary process.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The only statutory rules regarding the conduct of registered patent attorneys in New Zealand are set down in a disciplinary process provided under section 102(1) of the Patents Act 1953. Only the Commissioner of Patents (the <emphasis style="bold">Commissioner</emphasis>) or the New Zealand Institute of Patent Attorneys Inc (the <emphasis style="bold">NZIPA</emphasis>) may apply to the High Court for an order to remove a person’s name from the register of patent attorneys. A person may be removed where he or she has been convicted of a crime involving dishonesty, or has been guilty of misconduct, or has been guilty of grave impropriety or infamous conduct.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The process is, however, unsatisfactory for a range of reasons. The only disciplinary measure is cancellation of registration by the High Court. A lesser penalty (such as a reprimand or suspension of a patent attorney’s registration) is not available even though this might be more appropriate to the circumstances of the complaint. An aggrieved person is unable to pursue a complaint against the patent attorney. There is no obligation upon the Commissioner nor the NZIPA to take action in respect of any complaint. The circumstances in which a complaint may be made are unclear. Pursuing disciplinary action in the High Court is a lengthy and expensive process.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Because of these reasons, the statutory rules may be operating as a barrier to an aggrieved person pursuing a complaint and may account for why only one application has been to the High Court to cancel a person’s registration as a patent attorney in recent years. It is, however, difficult to determine the extent of any problem concerning the standards of service provided by patent attorneys in the absence of a complaints mechanism that is accessible to the public.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Membership of the NZIPA is voluntary and members are required to adhere to a code of conduct. The Council of the NZIPA has established a disciplinary process. In such cases where the NZIPA determines that disciplinary action is required, but where the circumstances do not warrant pursuing cancellation of the member’s registration, the NZIPA may only censure or expel a member. Neither action, however, will have any effect on that person’s ability to continue practising as a patent attorney. The NZIPA is generally unable to take action in respect of a complaint against those registered patent attorneys who are not members. Further, membership of the NZIPA does not appear to be promoted to the public as a means by which the public can be assured of an acceptable standard of service from NZIPA members.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Currently the NZIPA, while representing the majority of New Zealanders who are registered patent attorneys, does not represent the majority of all persons registered as patent attorneys. Requiring all registered patent attorneys to belong to the NZIPA would raise issues under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 about freedom of persons to associate. In addition, in such a small profession, there is a potential risk that the NZIPA may face a conflict of interest in managing a disciplinary process.</text>

          <text>This option would require all registered patent attorneys to adopt the Australian code of conduct provided under the Australian Patents Act 1990, with their disciplinary process, including the establishment of a disciplinary tribunal, being replicated in New Zealand.

The Act would specify the grounds on which a complaint could be made, the procedure for making a complaint, and the orders following any breach of acceptable standards of service. An independent disciplinary tribunal would be responsible for hearing the complaint and for determining the orders following any breach of acceptable standards of service.</text>

        <para>
          <text>In 2003 Cabinet agreed to an independent disciplinary tribunal (<emphasis style="bold">tribunal</emphasis>) to inquire into and determine complaints about patent attorneys. This change was modelled largely on the then Australian regime for patent attorneys.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Australian regime for the regulation of patent attorneys has recently been under review. The review identified that the majority of complaints about patent attorneys do not concern matters related to disciplinary issues. Furthermore, the number of complaints about patent attorneys considered by the Australian tribunal was low (averaging about 1 or 2 per year). Setting up and maintaining a similar tribunal in New Zealand on this basis is therefore likely to be an inefficient and ineffective mechanism to resolve most complaints about patent attorneys.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In order to provide a more efficient and effective disciplinary procedure in the Patents Bill, it is proposed to dispense with the tribunal and transfer its functions to the Patent Attorneys’ Professional Standards Board (the <emphasis style="bold">Standards Board</emphasis>) to be set up under the Patents Bill, and to give the Standards Board the authority to direct parties to a complaint to explore the possibility of resolving or settling the complaint or issues relating to the complaint that do not raise disciplinary issues by negotiation, conciliation, or mediation.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Status quo and problem</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The patent attorney profession is currently regulated under the Patents Act 1953. There are around 511 patent attorneys registered to practice in New Zealand. Around 67% of these are Australian resident patent attorneys who have taken advantage of the provisions in the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangements (<emphasis style="bold">TTMRA</emphasis>) to register for practice in New Zealand. Following a review of the regulation of the patent attorney profession under the Patents Act 1953, Cabinet agreed on 31 March 2003 that the licensing regime for patent attorneys should continue to be provided under patent legislation with a number of modifications designed to modernise and more closely align the regulation of the patent attorney profession with Australia. A recent review of the Australian regulatory regime for patent attorneys conducted by the Professional Standards Board for Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys (the <emphasis style="bold">PSB</emphasis>) identified 2 areas where changes to the disciplinary regime were considered necessary.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The PSB found that most complaints between patent attorneys and their clients did not involve disciplinary issues, rather, the complaints related to, for example, disputes over costs, unpaid bills, or other related aspects of the relationship. Disputes in which there is evidence that the patent attorney had acted inappropriately are rare (an average of around 1 complaint per year). Anecdotal evidence in New Zealand suggests nearly all disputes fall into the former category.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Furthermore, the PSB considered that the present disciplinary regime did not make any distinction between those complaints that raised issues that are truly disciplinary in nature and those that do not. The result is that a client who wishes to resolve a dispute with a patent attorney not involving a disciplinary issue has to allege that the patent attorney has acted in a way that merits disciplinary action.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Cabinet agreed to the Patents Act 1953 being amended (EDC Min (03) 35 and CAB Min (03) 11/5 refer) to provide for all complaints about patent attorneys to be referred to the tribunal for inquiry and determination. Where the tribunal determines that the patent attorney has breached any acceptable standards of service, it may make orders for his or her registration to be removed or suspended, and for the patent attorney to be censured, fined, required to refund money, return property, or remedy the complaint.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Referring all complaints to the disciplinary tribunal, where the majority (if not all the complaints) do not involve disciplinary issues, is likely to provide an ineffective and inefficient mechanism for settling those complaints. Furthermore, if few complaints involve disciplinary issues, the cost of setting up and maintaining a disciplinary tribunal would not be justified.</text>

        <para>
          <text>It was not considered feasible or practical to transfer the functions of the disciplinary tribunal to another disciplinary body set up for another occupational group because the knowledge and skills to become a patent attorney are unique to that profession.

        <para>
          <text>The proposal to transfer the functions of the tribunal to the Standards Board would eliminate the costs associated with setting up and maintaining the tribunal. While there would be some additional costs to the Standards Board to administer the disciplinary regime, an increase in costs is likely to be small, as the number of complaints arising from disputes involving disciplinary issues are likely to be small and infrequent. The costs incurred by the Standards Boards are, however, to be recovered from the profession though registration and renewal fees payable by patent attorneys in New Zealand. There are no business compliance costs associated with this proposal.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In addition, the Standards Board is to be provided with the authority to first direct parties to a complaint to explore the possibility of resolving the complaint by negotiation, conciliation, or mediation before the Standards Board undertakes to determine the complaint. Providing the Standards Board with such an authority would assist the parties to a complaint to settle their dispute or parts of a dispute without the client needing to allege disciplinary issues. It would also assist to keep expenditure of the Standards Board resources for inquiring into and determining a compliant against the patent attorney to a minimum when disciplinary action is not warranted.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The proposed amendments would therefore create a more efficient and effective regime for settling the range of disputes that are likely to arise between patent attorneys and their clients. These changes to the dispute procedures would also be consistent with recent developments in the regulation of occupational groups in New Zealand such as the passing of the Building Act 2004, Registered Architects Act 2005, and the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006. Governing boards of professional groups are being given more responsibility for maintaining the reputation of their respective professions and the ability to refer parties to a complaint to an independent arbitrator or negotiator to settle the complaint or parts of the complaint that do not raise disciplinary issues.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Implementation and review</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Changes to the disciplinary provisions for the patent attorney profession are to be implemented in a Patents Bill currently being prepared for introduction into the House of Representatives later this year. Following enactment of the Patents Bill, regulations will be developed that will include the change in work experience required by a person registering as a patent attorney.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Information about the requirements to register as patent attorneys and changes being introduced under the Patents Bill will be available from the Ministry of Economic Development’s websites, including that of the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand’s website.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Ministry of Economic Development will monitor the effectiveness of the changes to the regulation of the patent attorney profession after the new Patents Act comes into force, with the view to conducting a review of the new Patents Act after 5 years.</text>

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Consultation</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>Targeted consultation was undertaken with both the New Zealand Institute of Patent Attorneys Inc and the Institute of Patent and Trade Marks Attorneys of Australia. The proposals were also discussed at the New Zealand Institute’s annual conferences in 2005 and 2006. Both groups support the preferred option.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Government departments and ministries consulted were: Te Puni Kokiri, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Department for Courts, the New Zealand Customs Service, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Research, Science and Technology, and the Treasury. No concerns were raised with the preferred option. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was informed of the proposals.</text>
