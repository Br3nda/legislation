          <text>The purpose of the Policing (Constable's Oaths Validation) Amendment Bill 2009 is to remove any doubt about the validity of constabulary powers conferred on those Police employees who took the constable's oath between 1 October 2008 and 12 October 2009.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>On 1 October 2008 the Policing Act 2008 came into force, replacing the Police Act 1958. Prior to 1 October 2008 the constable's oath was taken before a Justice or commissioned officer of Police pursuant to section 37 of the Police Act 1958. On and from 1 October 2008 section 22 of the Policing Act instituted a new procedure for administering the constable's oath.  </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Between 1 October 2008 and 12 October 2009 the constable's oaths were administered to Police employees graduating from the Royal New Zealand Police College (RNZPC) by senior Police employees based at RNZPC. No new authorisations were issued between 1 October 2008 and 12 October 2009 and persons who had the authority to administer the oath under section 37 of the Police Act 1958 assumed that that authorisation continued under section 22 of the Policing Act 2008.  </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>As the procedures in place under the Police Act 1958 carried over past 1 October 2008, this has given rise to doubt about whether the constable's oaths administered to Police employees from that date until 13 October 2009 were effective in conferring constabulary powers on those employees. The Policing (Constable's Oaths Validation) Amendment Bill 2009 is validating legislation that deems the oaths of office taken by affected Police employees to have been administered as if the persons administering them had been authorised by the Commissioner of Police and had complied with the requirement of section 22(2) of the Policing Act 2008.  </text>
