        <para>
          <text>Reviews of the Private Investigators and Security Guards Act 1974 (the <def-term id="DLM1594402">reviews</def-term>) were undertaken in 2001–03 and 2007.  The content of the Bill reflects the findings of those reviews.</text>

          <text>Under the Private Investigators and Security Guards Act 1974 persons have been required to be licensed if running businesses—</text>

                <text>guarding properties, or monitoring burglar alarms or similar warning devices, or monitoring security cameras.</text>
              </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Similarly, any persons they have employed or engaged to perform the work for which they themselves require a licence have also been required to be licensed.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The reviews identified a need to clarify and extend these licensing requirements, in order to avoid unnecessary risks to clients and employers, to members of the public, and to security personnel themselves.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The reviews also identified a need to licence persons who are employed or engaged to perform crowd control services, even if they do not work for businesses offering those services to others (eg, even if they work directly for a place selling liquor rather than for a separate business offering, or providing, crowd control services to that place).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In addition, one of the findings of the reviews was that requiring relicensing in March every year, for both licence and certificate holders, imposes heavy costs on the industry and produces few, if any, benefits that less frequent relicensing would produce. Less frequent relicensing, with the relicensing date depending on the date at which the current licence or certificate was applied for, was identified as desirable.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Training requirements</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Under the Private Investigators and Security Guards Act 1974 there has been no provision for introducing mandatory training requirements for persons licensed under the Act.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This was identified in the reviews as a major shortcoming. Mandatory training requirements were identified as highly desirable for staff likely to encounter violence or potentially violent situations in the course of their work.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Rules of conduct including possible codes of ethics</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Under the Private Investigators and Security Guards Act 1974, private investigators and their staff have been required to comply with a number of restrictions on how they carry out their work. In particular, it has been an offence to, in connection with the business of a private investigator, make visual or audio recordings of another person without the prior written consent of that person, except for purposes of identifying that person for the purpose of identifying someone on whom a legal process is to be or has been served.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The reviews concluded that maintaining these restrictions is desirable, in particular to protect the right of privacy.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Act also contains a provision for introducing codes of ethics by regulation for persons licensed under the Act, although no codes of ethics have ever been promulgated. The reviews concluded that retaining this regulation-making power is desirable also, since having codes of ethics can assist in raising and then maintaining standards.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Offence provisions modernised and penalties increased</explnote.subhead2>

              <para>
                <text>maximum penalties were not sufficiently high to defer offending against the Act, and, in particular, insufficiently high to deter unlicensed businesses from operating in the industry and unlicensed staff from working in the industry.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Administration and enforcement</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The reviews identified a number of changes that could be made to improve the administration of the Act, including—</text>
          <list>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>

          </list>
        </para>
        <para>

          <text>In addition, volunteers performing work that falls within the strict definition of crowd control are also necessary to the smooth and safe running of many sporting and social events. Furthermore, in most cases licensing would appear manifestly excessive given the type and magnitude of the risks associated with such work, and it might even discourage enough people being employed to perform it to create a safe environment. A volunteer will not need to possess a certificate provided they are not paid to perform the work in question.</text>

          <text>The Bill will enable training requirements to be prescribed for security and private investigation staff. Cabinet has agreed that when the new legislation comes into force property guards, personal guards, and crowd controllers will all have to undertake mandatory training.</text>

          <text>The detailed training requirements have yet to be developed, and will be developed in consultation with the hospitality and security industries as well as industry training bodies.

Penalties for offences will significantly increase to a level where, while remaining proportionate to the offences committed, they provide an effective deterrent to offending. The present maximum fine for an offence against the Act is $2,000. In future, the maximum fine under the Act, for operating an unlicensed business, will be $40,000 for an individual and $60,000 for a corporation.</text>

          <text>Licensing and disciplinary decisions under the current Act are made by the Registrar of Private Investigators and Security Guards. The Registrar is appointed, with security of tenure for a 3-year term, by the Minister of Justice and provided with administrative support by the Ministry of Justice.  The Registrar’s decisions can be appealed to the District Court.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Enforcement</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Demands on police resources mean that the police cannot prioritise enforcement of offences under the Act. For instance, only 5 prosecutions in the District Court for breaches of the Act have been undertaken since 1 January 2000. There appear to be significant numbers of unlicensed operators in the industry, although the size of the problem is difficult to gauge.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Continuing to allow what appears to be relatively widespread non-compliance is inappropriate.

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Increasing the period between licensing renewals would lower the costs associated with licensing. There appear to be few risks associated with requiring licences to be renewed only every 5 years.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The decision was therefore taken to require licensees to renew their licences every 5 years, and re-register annually. When re-registering, the licence-holder will be asked to verify their contact details and list the certificate holders who are working for them.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The decision was therefore taken to increase penalties to levels that are not inconsistent with other occupational regulatory schemes and that will more effectively deter offending. In particular, the penalty for operating an unlicensed security business will go up from $2,000 to $40,000 for an individual and to $60,000 for a company.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The fees for licences and certificates, together with various other costs associated with licensing (such as the cost of preparing an application and some District Court costs relating to licensed persons), need to be set against the benefits of licensing people. By far the most significant costs here will be licensing fees.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The benefits of licensing are more difficult to quantify than the costs. They relate to excluding persons who would perform security-related work who present as unsuitable according to specified criteria, which means reduced risks to persons, to property, and to the right to privacy.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A possible exception is where there is either dual licensing or possibly a professional organisation with suitable and stringent membership requirements.

        <para>
          <text>It is also apparent that there are some major gaps in the existing legislation. Persons running businesses guarding property are required to be licensed, along with any of their employees engaged in that work. However, people running businesses providing crowd control services (regulating entry to premises, maintaining order on premises, or removing persons from premises—work that is mostly done in and around where alcohol is sold and consumed) are not required to be licensed, and neither are the employees doing the work. There is a similar gap in respect of persons running businesses supplying bodyguard services or staff to guard prisoners, and any of their employees engaged in that work.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The risks that would result from having violent or dishonest people doing this work are, if anything, generally even greater than the risks associated with them doing work that currently requires a licence. The gap in respect of crowd control services is particularly problematic, given the level of violence associated with alcohol and places where alcohol is sold and consumed.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The decision was therefore made to extend licensing to—</text>

        <para>
          <text>The definition of <def-term id="DLM1594429">crowd controller</def-term> and the regulation-making power in the Bill are intended to ensure that the impact of extending licensing is not unduly onerous, and that the costs are proportionate to the expected benefits (eg, in the case of event security).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Consideration was then given to whether in-house security staff should also be licensed (ie, where a business does not engage an external security services provider, but rather employs security personnel directly).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Benefits and costs in this area are difficult to quantify. Only in the case of crowd controllers was there felt to be a situation where the benefits of licensing in-house security personnel would clearly outweigh the costs. An additional consideration here is that many of the risks associated with poor work by crowd controllers clearly fall on persons other than the person or business that hired them.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The decision was therefore taken to require persons who are employed as crowd controllers to be licensed, even if they do not work for businesses offering those services to others (eg, even if they work directly for a bar, rather than for a separate business providing crowd control services to that bar).</text>

        <para>
          <text>It is estimated that these proposals will result in approximately 1 250 persons acquiring licences and a further 16 750 acquiring a certificate of approval in the first year of the new regime’s operation. There is expected to be an average of approximately 20% turnover in the industry each year (excluding movements within the industry).</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Training</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The current Act does not require security personnel to undertake mandatory training in order to become or remain licensed. Having competent personnel is important and a decision was therefore made to provide regulation-making power that would permit introducing mandatory training for any class of licensee.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It was considered that the high risks associated with crowd control and guarding property or individuals justify some mandatory training of security staff in these categories. However, the amount of training that is desirable is more difficult to establish.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Contrary to those practises, in New Zealand there is a well-regarded course for door staff at licensed premises—and most crowd controllers are expected to be primarily employed as door staff in licensed establishments. This involves only two 3-hour sessions of contact time, plus an additional assessment session. However well run, there are severe limitations on what can be taught in such a brief time.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>With the training requirements still having to be prescribed, any costing of the training requirements is difficult. Costings have been carried out on the assumption that training requiring an average of approximately 12 to 18 hours of contact time will be prescribed for employees. This is based on preliminary research by officials, which included attending the well-regarded course for door staff referred to above. It is estimated that this training would cost approximately $300 per person.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Up to 75% of those required to hold certificates of approval are expected to fall within the categories where training will be mandatory—namely, employee property guards, employee personal guards, and employee crowd controllers.</text>

              <para>
                <text>it is expected that there will be some limited grandparenting arrangements that reduce the number required to undertake training in the first year, even if they cannot produce evidence of prior training. Then in the first and subsequent years there will be people who will be able to be exempted because they can produce evidence of prior training. The details of these arrangements are still to be determined and this will be dealt with in regulations:</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Some employees in the first and subsequent years will have undertaken some sort of training anyway, even if it was not mandatory. The cost of this should not be counted as a cost against the new regime, as it would have occurred anyway. Licence holders can be expected to be considerably better trained than most of their staff, and the cost of the new regime for them, when it is prescribed, may be considerably less than for employees, again because so much of it would have occurred anyway.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Licensees currently have no powers (such as powers of arrest) greater than those of a member of the public. The current Act allows for regulations to introduce a code of ethics governing any class of licence holder within the industry, but this power has not been used.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill contains regulation-making power enabling a code of conduct to be prescribed for any class of licensee. Some overseas jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in Australia, have such codes in place for some categories of licensees in the security industry, and it may become desirable to introduce such codes here.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The current Act imposes a number of legal restrictions on how private investigators may operate. The restriction that has attracted the most attention is section 52, which prohibits photographing or audio-recording people without their consent.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Alternatives to section 52 were considered. However, covert surveillance clearly does bring potential for abuse. Recent incidents in New Zealand, including some high profile incidents, clearly raise the prospect that significant numbers of private investigators may irresponsibly use the power to photograph and audio-record people without their consent, if given this power. The decision was therefore taken to retain the existing approach.</text>

              <para>
                <text>new measures will be introduced to improve administration and enforcement of the regulatory regime. These include the creation of a dedicated enforcement unit to police the statutory requirements, and a move from annual licensing to 5-yearly licensing to eliminate unnecessary compliance costs:</text>

              <para>
                <text>the penalties for breaches of the regulatory regime will be strengthened. Offence provisions are updated and the maximum fines on conviction will be increased from $2,000 to $40,000 for an individual and to $60,000 for a company for the most serious offence (running a business without a licence). The maximum financial penalties the Licensing Authority can impose on individual licensees following a disciplinary hearing will be increased from $500 to $2,000:</text>

                <text>persons running businesses or performing various security-related roles will be subject to appropriate legal restrictions on their behaviour. The Bill makes no changes in this area and, in particular, the existing law prohibiting private investigators from taking photographs or audio-recordings without the subject’s written consent (except for a narrow range of purposes) will remain:</text>

                <text>persons will be prevented from running businesses that offer various security services and/or perform various security-related work if it appears that allowing them to do so will result in unacceptable levels of risk. Anyone who must currently be licensed will have to be licensed under the new regime, and licensing requirements will be clarified and extended to include personal guards, crowd controllers, employee personal guards, and employee crowd controllers. Employee crowd controllers will have to be licensed even if they are not working for someone who offers security services for hire.</text>
