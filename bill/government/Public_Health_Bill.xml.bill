          <text>The policy of this Bill is to update existing public health legislation in order to improve, promote, and protect public health and help attain optimal and equitable health outcomes for all population groups in New Zealand. The Bill will also enable New Zealand to comply with its obligations under the International Health Regulations 2005 (<emphasis style="bold">IHR 2005</emphasis>). The IHR 2005 came into force on 15 June 2007.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Background</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill will substantially replace the Health Act 1956, the Tuberculosis Act 1948, and associated regulations. The Health Act 1956 is New Zealand’s principal statute for public health, focusing primarily on environmental health and the control of communicable diseases. The Health Act 1956, the Tuberculosis Act 1948, and associated regulations have served New Zealand well, but their provisions are now outdated.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The process of reviewing the present legislative framework has been extensive, with several rounds of consultation based on 2 discussion documents. In 1998, <emphasis style="italic">Public health legislation review: A new public health legislative framework</emphasis> (Ministry of Health, 1998) was published. To further develop the detailed policy, a second round of consultation centred on the discussion document <emphasis style="italic">Public health legislation: promoting public health, preventing ill health and managing communicable diseases</emphasis> (Ministry of Health, 2002). This discussion document covered more detailed proposals for topics, including health information, screening, management of communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases, and border health protection.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Some changes have already been made to existing legislation through the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 and associated amendments to the Health Act 1956. These changes, primarily affecting emergency and quarantine provisions in the Health Act 1956, ensure an effective New Zealand response to the possibility of communicable disease-related emergencies such as that which could arise from pandemic influenza. The 2006 amendments are carried forward in this Bill.</text>

          <explnote.subhead1>Management of risks to public health</explnote.subhead1>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill has provisions that enable the making of regulations to set various controls on a specified activity in order to prevent, reduce, or eliminate the risks to public health associated with the activity. These provisions have a wide potential application and cover activities relating to goods and services with the potential to pose risks to public health. The provisions require the making of regulations in order to apply to any particular activity. The making of regulations will involve the usual processes for public consultation and assessment of regulatory impacts prior to Cabinet decisions. Examples of potential regulated activities include the management of camping grounds and hairdressing (both presently subject to regulatory licensing requirements).</text>

          <para>
            <text>The Bill continues the Health Act 1956’s mandate for a significant role for TAs, principally in relation to environmental health (that is, public health matters related primarily to the physical environment). Territorial authorities will have duties and discretionary powers to improve, promote, and protect public health within their districts. As with the current Health Act 1956, the TA role will span nuisances, bylaws, sanitary works, and, subject to regulations, activity consents and assessor/verification functions. As under the Health Act 1956 at present, TAs will have a duty to employ or otherwise provide for the employment of 1 or more environmental health officers. Territorial authorities will also be required to inspect their districts for nuisances and to take steps to manage them. In addition, as now, TAs will be required to comply with any direction by the Minister of Health relating to provision for sanitary works.</text>

          <para>
            <text>Reliable flows of accurate information are fundamental to health and disability policy and action. The Health Act 1956 currently has provisions to allow information about identified people to be exchanged between specified authorities. The Bill continues the provisions relating to routine information flows within the health and disability services sector, including information disclosure to support patient care and the funding of services throughout the health and disability sector.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill includes some modifications and clarifications to current provisions, for example, the requirement to provide information will apply to all funders and providers of health and disability services, including private providers, instead of to public providers only (as at present). This will have the effect of ensuring the provision of health and disability information to the Ministry of Health for compiling statistics and advancing knowledge, education, and health research. For many service providers this proposal will formalise existing arrangements.</text>
          </para>
          <explnote.subhead1>Notification</explnote.subhead1>
          <para>
            <text>Notification involves a duty on specified people (such as medical practitioners) to provide information to specified authorities about people with health issues of public health concern. Notification allows investigation and possible control measures (in relation to particular individuals and their contacts), and also provides data for surveillance purposes. It generally relates to cases of important communicable diseases. The duty in current legislation to notify specified conditions will be retained, but in a more detailed and flexible form.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill also includes a new duty to report an outbreak or cluster of cases of conditions, whether the condition is notifiable or not, or any other unexpected or unusual event of public health significance.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill specifies persons or service providers responsible for making notifications, in particular, medical practitioners and laboratories. Contaminants, for example, from environmental testing, will also be notifiable to medical officers of health by laboratories and in some cases also by the person who orders the test.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill includes a definition of condition to include diseases (whether communicable or not) and physical harm caused by chemical, radiation, or other exposure.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Specified persons and agencies will be required to notify conditions and contaminants, including pathogenic organisms. The Bill sets out criteria to guide decisions about which conditions and contaminants are to be specified as notifiable.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>As in the Health Act 1956, there will be provision for schedules setting out the list of notifiable conditions, and supporting details will be able to be amended by Order in Council.</text>

          <explnote.subhead1>Non-communicable diseases</explnote.subhead1>
          <para>
            <text>Public health legislation traditionally focuses on communicable diseases and environmental health. Although communicable disease and environmental health issues remain very significant, they are no longer the major causes of death and illness in New Zealand. The major causes of population ill-health today, and the major drivers of health care expenditure, are those broadly categorised as non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancers, mental illness, and addictions.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Reducing the impact of non-communicable diseases in the population requires intervention at a number of levels, as well as co-ordinated efforts across key sectors and settings that can support outcomes such as improved nutrition and physical activity. Legislation alone is not the answer, but, as experience with tobacco control has shown, appropriate legislative provisions can support effective public health action in a way that also reduces inequalities.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill includes principles and provisions for the making of codes or guidelines to address non-communicable disease risk factors. The Director-General will be able to make non-binding codes and guidelines to promote public health, for example, in relation to—</text>

          <explnote.subhead1>Management of communicable conditions and restrictive powers</explnote.subhead1>
          <para>
            <text>The Health Act 1956 and the Tuberculosis Act 1948 (along with associated regulations) have significant powers in relation to the control of people with communicable conditions such as legionnaires’ disease, AIDS, hepatitis, cholera, and tuberculosis. The Health Act 1956 provides for the detention of people with infectious diseases, by decision of the medical officer of health or health protection officer, with no time periods or appeal provisions specified other than that the person may be held until no longer infectious.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Provisions in the Bill cover rights, duties, offences, penalties, a range of restrictive powers, and procedures for decisions and urgent orders for people with significant communicable conditions. The provisions reflect the need to exercise management options that place as few restrictions as possible on the person concerned while, at the same time, meeting public health objectives.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill sets out an incremental range of restrictive powers. Powers at the lesser end of the range (such as requiring a person to attend a particular health care programme or refrain from certain activities) will be able to be exercised by a medical officer of health. The lack of such intermediate powers has been identified as a weakness in the current legislation.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The more restrictive powers (for example, detention) could only be exercised following a court order. Where urgent action is required to take measures to protect public health, an interim order for detention for up to 72 hours could be issued by a medical officer of health with immediate effect.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The relevant provisions in the Bill support the exercise of the least restrictive alternative in relation to people with communicable conditions to the maximum extent compatible with achieving public health outcomes.</text>

            <text>A medical officer of health may give a limited range of directions in respect of someone who is a contact of a person with a notifiable condition or a carrier (for example, a requirement to be tested, or to remain at home, or to be excluded from school).</text>

            <text>Section 126 of the Health Act 1956 allows for the committal of infirm or neglected persons who are living in insanitary conditions or without proper care or attention. While section 126 is rarely formally invoked, its existence as a last resort is useful in resolving difficult situations. In this Bill, a new version of section 126 provides for residence orders.</text>

          <explnote.subhead1>Contact tracing</explnote.subhead1>
          <para>
            <text>Contact tracing is one way to investigate and manage communicable conditions. It involves identifying and seeking people who have been in contact with a person with a communicable disease in order to prevent further spread of the disease and to offer testing and treatment to people at risk. The present legislation has very few provisions to support contact tracing (which is mostly in secondary legislation), and these tend to be limited to contacts who have already been identified, rather than tracing further contacts.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill authorises contact tracing and specifies criteria, relevant conditions, and procedures in the primary legislation rather than in regulations. In practice, most contact tracing will take place, as now, with the consent of the person with the original condition. The Bill, however, authorises contact tracing where the person concerned does not voluntarily inform others and any infringement of the person’s privacy is justified on public health grounds. Procedures for contact tracing will vary, depending on the availability of personally identifying details and urgency.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Where identifying information is not available to a medical officer of health, a health practitioner will be primarily responsible for undertaking contact tracing by requesting the person with the condition to communicate appropriately with contacts. If this is not successful, the medical officer of health will be able to initiate contact tracing.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>People with relevant conditions will have a duty to provide, as far as practicable, information, including names, identifying details, and addresses of contacts, as well as other information relating to the circumstances and source of the relevant condition.</text>

            <text>Health practitioners, in limited circumstances, will be authorised but not required to disclose to partners and family or household members information on risks posed to them by a partner or family or household member with a communicable condition. Relevant criteria for the exercise of such discretion include the serious nature of the condition, a significant risk of infection through close contact, and the failure of the person with the condition to take steps to inform and protect a partner or family or household members.</text>

          <explnote.subhead1>Border health protection</explnote.subhead1>
          <para>
            <text>The Health Act 1956 provisions relating to border health protection and quarantine are out of date given trends in international travel since 1956, new and emerging threats such as SARS and pandemic influenza, and changes in international law. The present Health Act 1956 enables implementation of New Zealand’s obligations under the International Health Regulations 1969 (<def-term id="DLM1049070">IHR 1969</def-term>). The IHR 1969 were revised by the World Health Organization (WHO), adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2005 (<def-term id="DLM1049071">IHR 2005</def-term>), and came into force in June 2007.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The IHR 2005 have a wider scope than earlier international law in relation to risks to public health. The IHR 2005 also have more explicit obligations in relation to public health surveillance and response capacities, both at the border and within countries. They allow for potential controls on people departing as well as arriving (to prevent export of sources of risks to public health).</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill provides that the primary role of health agencies at the border relates to human health protection. It relates in particular to people and craft coming into, or leaving, New Zealand as possible sources of infection, as well as human environments and sanitary conditions associated with craft and around ports and airports.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill has an expanded scope for border health protection consistent with the IHR 2005. The Health Act 1956 lists yellow fever, plague, cholera, and human-transmitted avian influenza as quarantinable diseases. The expanded scope of the IHR 2005 focuses on controlling the spread between countries of all conditions and events that may adversely affect the health of human populations. These include any diseases or other risks, such as emerging conditions like SARS and new forms of human influenza, but also harm caused by chemical and radionuclear sources.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill follows the approach adopted in the IHR 2005 and allows the Ministry of Health to have a high-level, national-overview responsibility for border health protection, while recognising that other agencies may be responsible for delivering some services.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill provides that all persons entering New Zealand may be required to provide information (for example, travel history) and submit to non-invasive screening measures. There are also provisions for screening and surveillance (for example, by reporting to a medical practitioner in their home town) or, as a last resort, isolation or quarantine in a suitable facility.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill also specifies, in accordance with the IHR 2005, and as currently provided in the Health Act 1956, that craft crossing the border (ships and aircraft) must meet certain requirements to obtain health clearance (that is, pratique) and sanitation certification. Ports, airports, and conveyance operators must also ensure that they are free of such vectors as rats and mosquitoes and that the import and the export of organisms that pose risks to public health are minimised. There are also provisions relating to goods and organisms as possible sources of risk to human health.</text>

          <para>
            <text>The Bill largely reflects the legislation enacted in 2006 (the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 and Health Amendment Act 2006). The provisions of this Bill, however, apply to a broader range of public health emergencies, irrespective of cause (that is, communicable conditions as well as emergencies arising from biological, chemical, or radiological factors).</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill specifies powers for medical officers of health on the declaration of a public health emergency. These powers are similar to those in the present Health Act 1956 (special powers) but are more comprehensive. As now, the powers will be able to be enforced, for example, with the assistance of the police. These powers include an ability to limit movement, to close premises such as workplaces and schools (or to allow them to remain open only under specified conditions), and to require quarantine and isolation.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>The emergency powers include an ability to detain people if preventive treatment, including vaccination, is declined. The justification for needing this power is the potential devastation for the whole community that could result from a full-scale new disease epidemic, or terrorist reintroduced smallpox, for example. The Bill does not authorise physical administration of treatment in the case of non-compliance. Non-compliance could result in detention for quarantine purposes.</text>
          </para>
          <explnote.subhead1>Other provisions</explnote.subhead1>
          <para>
            <text>The Bill includes provisions that encourage, but that do not require, health impact assessments for new proposals, for example, in relation to policy development and decision making by central and local government.</text>

          <para>
            <text>The Bill includes specific powers (primarily relevant to children) in relation to screening and exclusion from schools in the case of disease outbreaks, and other regulation-making powers for immunisation, such as the authorisation of school-based immunisation recording. The Bill provides for a limited version of the Health Act 1956 provision on the examination of children to allow an authorised person to enter a pre-school or school in order to examine, test, or screen children, and to allow an authorised person to examine, test, or screen children where the parent consents; and, where there is no consent, for the authorised person to refer the child to an appropriately qualified health practitioner for further investigation and follow-up.</text>

The Health Act 1956 definition of health information is therefore somewhat more limited than that in the <emphasis style="italic">Health Information Privacy Code</emphasis>, and this could compromise the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of public health surveillance.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The 2001 Cabinet decisions included general provisions for the notification and surveillance of diseases. The decisions also envisaged that notification duties be extended beyond District Health Boards to encompass ‘medical practitioners, medical/diagnostic laboratories, and others’ (including community-based services). However, the decision did not specify criteria for when a disease should be notifiable, who should notify and their responsibilities, and how notification should occur. As a result, it is not transparent how the interests of the public, individuals, and potential notifiers would be balanced.</text>

          <text>The 2001 Cabinet decisions provided for the establishment and maintenance of registers and register-based programmes for diseases, syndromes, conditions and other issues. The relationship of the provisions to the Official Information Act 1982 was also addressed. Generic provisions include national or sub-national registers, opt-on and opt-off registers, and privacy safeguards. The registers are to be created by regulations. However, the decisions do not specify the purpose and objectives to guide whether registers should be established and in what form. Clarity is important given the range of conditions for which registers could later be established, and the ensuing implications about privacy issues.</text>

          <text>The 2001 Cabinet decisions did not address genetic screening. Specific attention should be paid to whether the scope of the Bill is to include genetic screening because it can be controversial, and because a current comprehensive screening programme (that is, the Guthrie test) may be considered to constitute a form of genetic screening. The Guthrie test consists of metabolic testing of newborn babies. There would be advantages in the Bill not excluding genetic screening in order to allow its potential application to the Guthrie test programme, if it is decided in the future that this is appropriate, and because other possible uses for genetic screening are evolving rapidly. Although confidentiality of individual information is addressed in the Privacy Act 1993 and the <emphasis style="italic">Health Information Privacy Code</emphasis>, the Guthrie test raises issues about the holding and use of medical samples that may warrant more specific regulatory detail than the Act and its Code are able to provide (as recommended by the  Privacy Commissioner’s report on the Guthrie Test.) The growing range of possible uses of medical samples means that, increasingly, individual privacy rights may require additional protection and specific rules.</text>

        <explnote.crosshead>Management of people with communicable conditions and use of restrictive powers</explnote.crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The 2001 Cabinet decisions included general approval that the Bill would include powers to manage significant and emergent risks to public health that were not otherwise managed effectively. The control of people with communicable diseases is an example. The Health Act 1956 provides for powers to detain people with infectious diseases without time limits or appeal provisions. The issue is the range of powers that would be appropriate (and under what circumstances) to ensure a person undergoes a test, is examined, or remains isolated from others, and what checks and balances should be available. This involves a balancing of the interests of public health with the rights of individuals.</text>

          <text>In extreme emergency circumstances (such as the threat of a pandemic with serious health impacts), mandatory vaccination might be in the best interest of public health.

          <text>There is a related issue about what range of powers should be available when a person is found to be living in unsanitary conditions or without adequate care. The Health Act 1956 provides a power to remove persons from their homes but does not provide for less restrictive alternatives (such as a requirement to accept help with cleaning and meals), which may both be more appropriate in the circumstances and more consistent with human rights.</text>

Nor did it include the detail on the legislative relationships between the health sector and other agencies with overlapping interests in border control (such as Customs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF)). For example, control of cross-border movements of poultry with avian influenza is of interest both from a biosecurity and human health perspective. Nor were the 2001 decisions able to predict with detail the direction taken by the revised WHO IHRs (now finalised by the World Health Assembly in May 2005). Issues are—</text>

          <text>An assessment of the financial implications for central government in relation to developing and administering the proposed Bill was included in the papers approved by Cabinet in 2001. At that stage, the estimated costs to the Ministry for developing the Bill and for 12 months prior to its enactment (including costs of policy development, drafting instructions and a methodology for developing subordinate legislation, and the proposed monitoring regime) was between $100,000 and $250,000 for the years 2002/03 to 2004/05 (personnel and operating costs).</text>

In addition, costs associated with transitional arrangements were estimated as approximately $0.5 million. The Ministry considers these estimates remain valid. Transitional and implementation costs will include information for the health sector, the general public and particular stakeholders. Training needs should also be considered and manuals rewritten.</text>

          <text>The Bill will provide for a more effective allocation of powers and duties at the central and local levels. This will ensure greater clarity and efficiency of responses to, and action on, public health issues (in particular through clarifying the roles of public health officers in relation to their employing agencies, usually district health boards and territorial authorities). Provision for operationalisation of district protocols at the local levels, in particular between district health boards and territorial authorities, will allow local agencies to work out arrangements in advance of how overlapping functions should be fulfilled in particular circumstances, and will facilitate planning for prevention and mitigation of public health emergencies. Implementation of the Bill will involve some time spent in staff training and development costs.</text>

          <text>The cost of ship sanitary certification may be increased to a small extent as a result of the more extensive scope of inspection and hygiene checks that will be included in revised certification. At present ships in New Zealand ports pay $150 for "deratting certification". This does not cover the real costs of the present inspection. The new regime will go beyond inspection for rats, and should be adjusted upwards to recover to a greater extent some of the costs of certification. This regime will be global in its coverage and New Zealand requirements will be identical to those of other countries.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The proposals outlined in this paper have been the subject of a detailed public consultation process. In November 2002, the discussion paper <emphasis style="italic">Public Health Legislation: Promoting public health, preventing ill health and managing communicable diseases</emphasis> was released. As part of the consultation process, the Ministry held a series of meetings and workshops in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch in early 2003. Over 180 people attended these meetings, of which there were 9. A total of 606 submissions were received from 1 190 signatories. More than 300 <quote.in quote="1">form</quote.in> letters from individuals and groups with concerns about immunisation were received. Other issues on which there was a broad range of opinion included the extent to which the legislation should include <quote.in quote="1">last-resort</quote.in> powers (such as detention) to assist in managing serious communicable diseases, and the issue of whether and how the Bill could address NCD risk factors. Views on registers, screening, and contact tracing varied. The proposals developed following analysis of the submissions, and in order to address concerns to the greatest extent possible, are a middle course between extremes of positions.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In particular, the provisions that provide for managing serious communicable diseases require a greater range of procedural safeguards than in the Health Act 1956. Powers of detention would no longer be able to be exercised by a statutory officer but by a court (except in urgent cases and then only for a maximum of 72 hours). This, together with other safeguards, should help allay concerns about the appropriate use of ‘last-resort powers. Concerns about registers, screening, and immunisation are addressed by the fact that general provisions in the Bill will only be operative if and when regulations are made to invoke them. Such regulations will require their own consultative procedures, privacy impact assessments, and regulatory impact assessments. Issues relevant to contact tracing most relate to concerns about privacy and control of information. The proposals have been recast to emphasise to a significant extent the role of patients in communicating with their own contacts, except where this is not effective and the risks to public health are significant. The proposals relating to non-communicable diseases are relatively minor, but provide to some extent for future changes (and hence another opportunity to address concerns expressed by a range of sector groups in consultation on the 2002 discussion document) by the concept of a legislative report-back.) These concerns were diverse, ranging from the view that there was no need for legislation to address NCD risk factors, to the view that a very comprehensive framework to address NCD risk factors is required. The provision for codes is therefore a compromise between those who supported the need for binding regulation-making powers and those who did not consider the Bill as an appropriate way to progress such issues. The legislative report-back will allow for further opportunities to review these issues and the options then available.</text>

          <text>The proposal for notification of pathological organisms or contaminants may result in some additional compliance costs on medical laboratories in particular. For example, they may need to put in place a check in their current processes to ensure the relevant authority (eg, a medical officer of health) is also alerted. However, any incremental costs will be minimal given that it will involve sending information that is already collated to 2 recipients rather than 1, and given that medical laboratories already have processes in place to share such health information.
