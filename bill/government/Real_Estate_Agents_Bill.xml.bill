          <text>This Bill replaces the Real Estate Agents Act 1976 and introduces a new regulatory framework for the real estate industry that will promote and protect the interests of consumers in real estate transactions by raising industry standards, improving licensing requirements and licensing procedures, providing mandatory disclosure obligations, and providing accountability through an independent, transparent, and effective disciplinary process.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Real Estate Agents Act 1976 is over 30 years old and lacks many of the modern consumer protection features associated with more recent legislation. It provides for a system of industry self-regulation that lacks independence, transparency, and accountability. This, combined with the significant risk posed to consumers from real estate activity such as mishandling of funds, poor contractual advice, misleading representations, conflicts of interest, and misuse of information, make it essential to provide a regulatory framework that affords consumers an adequate level of protection.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The new regulatory framework will ensure that real estate agency services are offered only by suitably licensed persons, having regard, in particular, to the need to protect consumers and that licensees meet strict eligibility criteria (including meeting fit and proper person requirements and passing the appropriate examinations) and are subject to clearly specified and strict rules of conduct in their business dealings. The framework provides a modern, independent, and robust complaints and disciplinary regime that will offer consumers a transparent, low-cost option for seeking remedies if things go wrong.</text>

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Executive summary</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>A range of problems currently exist with the disciplinary system for real estate agents under the Real Estate Agents Act 1976. Concern has been raised by the public and by real estate agents themselves about how effectively the industry deals with complaints and disciplinary matters.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The risks associated with real estate activity include: mishandling of funds, poor contractual advice, misleading representations, conflicts of interest, abuse of rights of access to property, and misuse of information. Given the significant risk to consumers that real estate agents and their salespeople present, it is considered essential that the regulatory framework governing the conduct and work of real estate agents affords the consumer an adequate level of protection.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (<def-term id="DLM1151918">REINZ</def-term>) and the Real Estate Agents Licensing Board (the <def-term id="DLM1151919">Licensing Board</def-term>) are responsible for the industry disciplinary processes. Some recent high profile cases have highlighted significant shortcomings with these processes, such as a lack of independence, transparency, and accountability. Concern has also been expressed about a lack of redress for consumers where things have gone wrong, excessive time delays in processing complaints, and about low penalties imposed in proportion to the commission received. There has also been criticism that the 30-year-old Real Estate Agents Act 1976 is no longer fit for its purpose in that it lacks many of the features of modern consumer protection frameworks for other occupations, such as lawyers and conveyancers, motor vehicle traders, and builders.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>To address these concerns, the Government agreed to a full review of the Real Estate Agents Act 1976. Following the review, in July 2007, Cabinet agreed to the release of a public consultation paper to outline the Government’s preferred option for reform of the Real Estate Agents Act 1976.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The proposed reforms will allow consumers access to an independent, transparent, and robust complaints and disciplinary system that will have the powers necessary to impose effective penalties and remedies. The proposed reforms are wide-ranging and are designed to significantly increase consumer confidence in the real estate industry, thereby ensuring the healthy growth of the industry.</text>

        <para>
          <text>There are approximately 1 500 real estate agents in New Zealand and over 20 000 real estate salespeople. The average selling price of the 102 000 homes that were sold through real estate agents in New Zealand in 2006 was $310,400. The REINZ has estimated that approximately $1.5 billion passes through real estate agents’ trust accounts each year relating to deposits.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Recently cases have come to light where misconduct by real estate agents or their salespeople has resulted in a financial detriment to the consumer of tens of thousands of dollars. The risks that consumers are exposed to are significant and there is the possibility of considerable consumer detriment in terms of direct monetary loss and of costs associated with the time required to pursue remedies when things go wrong.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Real Estate Agents Act 1976 established a licensing regime that includes a complaints and disciplinary system covering agents and salespeople. The Act does not provide any consumer redress options, and consumers must seek remedies either directly from agents or through the courts.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Responsibility for industry regulation is shared between the REINZ and the Licensing Board. All licensed real estate agents must belong to the REINZ and both organisations are strongly affiliated to the real estate agent industry. The Licensing Board has responsibility for granting and renewing licenses and certificates of approval and hearing disciplinary matters that are referred to it by the REINZ. The REINZ makes a range of rules relating to the industry, including qualifications needed to become a real estate agent or salesperson and sets the ethical standards that REINZ members must comply with.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The REINZ is also responsible for deciding whether or not disciplinary action is taken against an agent or salesperson. It acts as a gate-keeper by deciding whether complaints are serious enough to be referred to the Licensing Board, which has the power to suspend or cancel licences. The vast majority of consumer complaints are dealt with at REINZ subcommittee level, which means that decisions about disciplinary action are taken by fellow real estate agents. The maximum fine that can be imposed by the REINZ subcommittee is $750. There is no consumer representation in the disciplinary process.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A review of the Real Estate Agents Act 1976 identified further problems with the current industry regulatory regime. There is concern over the high threshold required for suspension and removal of real estate agents and their salespeople and about the quality of the investigations undertaken. Where investigations do find that a real estate agent’s conduct has not been up to the level required, there is concern about the lack of proportionality between the potential high financial rewards for misconduct and the low level of penalties that can be imposed.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There is also concern about a lack of transparency, with no reporting requirements for either the REINZ or the Licensing Board, no statutory requirement to publish or report complaint decisions, a lack of accessibility for consumers to the complaints system with limited public information available, and no consumer representation in the disciplinary process.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The current regime is a self-regulatory model undertaken within a legislative framework and consequently there is a low level of independence from the industry. There is significant public and industry concern about whether the current licensing, complaints, and disciplinary processes are as effective as they could be in upholding industry standards.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Allowing this situation to continue runs the risk of leaving consumers exposed to an unacceptable level of risk and consequent potential financial detriment. It is also likely that failing to address this issue would fatally undermine the consumer confidence required for the healthy growth of the real estate industry.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Non-legislative option</explnote.subhead1>
        <explnote.subhead2>Enhanced self-regulation</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>This option allows the real estate industry to retain responsibility for how the industry operates. It has cost advantages in that it would avoid legislative changes and the set up and administrative costs of an independent body to oversee the industry. In 2006, the REINZ were asked to make proposals to the Government that would improve accountability and transparency within the industry. REINZ made proposals for improving the current disciplinary and investigation processes through a new code of practice for complaint procedures, updating the industry code of ethics and code of practice, and establishing a new team of trained professional investigators. However, their proposals failed to provide for a complaints and disciplinary regime with the necessary level of independence from the industry.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Enhancing self-regulation will not address the problems identified within the real estate industry. Unscrupulous agents are likely to remain outside the regime offering the consumer no real additional protection while those within the regime would continue to have insufficient incentives to comply with voluntary codes of practice. The complaints system would also continue to lack consumer representation and remain difficult to access. Without the imposition of mandatory standards and an independent, open, and transparent complaints and disciplinary process there is little likelihood that consumer confidence in the industry will be restored. For these reasons enhanced self-regulation is not thought to offer a suitable solution to the problems identified within the real estate industry.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Legislative options</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>A number of options with a legislative design that addresses the need for a combination of a disciplinary system and consumer redress were examined. All the legislative options examined are intended to be industry funded and would be free to the user.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Modified status quo</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>This option would require legislation to modify the Real Estate Agents Act 1976. The changes would allow the Licensing Board and REINZ committees to order compensation to be paid to consumers for the misconduct of real estate agents or their salespeople. It would also provide for new and increased penalties and would require an annual report of the activities of REINZ and the Licensing Board to be made public.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This option has the advantage of building off the existing organisations and relationships and would be industry funded. However, it is unlikely that a modified scheme could fully reflect modern standards for complaints and dispute resolution services. It would also fail to provide the independence from the industry that is required to restore consumer confidence.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Modified complaints handling model</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>This option would require legislation to establish a three-stage model for consumer complaints, similar to the one used for lawyers and conveyancers. The first stage would require REINZ to set up a complaints service to receive complaints and to provide public information about the service. The second stage would be the setting up of an independent Standards Committee to hear consumer complaints, and the third stage would be to establish the post of a Complaints Review Officer to review decisions made by the Standards Committee. A range of remedies would be available and there would be a Disciplinary Tribunal, with the ability to impose a range of penalties including fines, suspensions, and cancellation of licences where appropriate.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There is credibility in using a system that has previously been judged as suitable for New Zealand; however, it is not certain that this type of system would be sufficiently independent from the industry to restore consumer confidence in the wake of recent well-publicised consumer difficulties within the industry.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Ombudsman-style scheme</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>This option would involve an ombudsman-style model which would provide an independent body to investigate consumer complaints. It would have the ability to make binding decisions on redress for consumers. An independent body would be established with responsibility for handling disciplinary matters, with a range of disciplinary powers, including the ability to order fines, remedial training, and suspensions and cancellations of licences.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This option would provide the necessary level of independence from the industry, however, there would be difficulties in binding industry members to the scheme through a contractual-based system, as it would be restricted to REINZ members, which covers all real estate agents but not all salespeople whose membership is voluntary. There would also be potential conflict with the disciplinary code in the Real Estate Agents Act 1976 without further major modification of the Act.</text>

          <text>Under this type of licensing system certain people or groups of people are given the right to perform certain tasks. It offers a more flexible system than occupational regulation as the restrictions usually relate to a specific part of the job. This system is generally used where consumers face heavy costs when a task is performed badly, or where government wants to control who carries out certain functions for the State.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>However, the risks that exist in the real estate industry relate to the behaviours exhibited over a range of tasks and situations, including drafting contracts, holding funds, and negotiating sales. There is also a danger with this type of regulation that the tasks become outdated. For these reasons it is not thought that the real estate industry is suitable for this type of regulation.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Certification</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Certification is where an industry body certifies to the public that particular people have met requirements that indicate their ability to do the job effectively. A person who is certified has the exclusive right to use a certain title that indicates their standing within the industry. Uncertified people can offer services in competition with those that are certified, but are not permitted to use the certified title.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Certification would allow an informed choice, between using the services of those certified and those not, to be made by the consumer. It would also allow for increased competition and a reduction in costs to the consumer as those uncertified are likely to charge less for their services. In most cases the industry body offering certification will insist on those it certifies adhering to a code of conduct.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>However, in the context of the real estate industry, where both the vendor and purchaser face risk, the purchaser has no choice other than to deal with the vendors selected agent. Also under this system it leaves those uncertified outside of any code of conduct or other form of industry body control. It would also not allow for independent scrutiny of agents’ trust accounts. For these reasons, certification is not thought to be appropriate for the real estate industry.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Disclosure</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Disclosure is a regime that requires a person to disclose certain information to potential clients. It is usually used in sectors where there is a risk to people’s money such as the financial industry. It has the advantage of providing consumers wishing to use the service with information about the processes involved and about the person they are considering dealing with, which allows them to make an informed choice about the level of risk.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In the context of the real estate industry, this type of regulation is not sufficient to address the risk to purchasers from agents that have been chosen by the vendor. Nor does it address risk associated with the drawing up of binding contracts, with potential conflicts of interest, or the holding of purchase deposits.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Negative licensing</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Negative licensing is a system in which a person does not need a licence to provide a service but may be stopped from doing so in certain situations or if certain behaviours are exhibited. People can be stopped from providing a service if they break the law or do not meet certain standards when carrying out their job.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is not thought that this type of regulation, in the context of the complexity and value of real estate industry transactions, offers sufficient protection for consumers.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Preferred option</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>In March 2007, Cabinet noted a range of problems with the Real Estate Agents Act 1976 and agreed to a full review of it, including the entry and annual licensing requirements, consumer redress, discipline and general regulation of real estate agents; activities. In May 2007, the Government’s preferred option for reform of the Real Estate Agents Act 1976 was published.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Occupational regulation with new independent licensing, complaints, and disciplinary schemes is the preferred model. This will require primary legislation to replace the existing Real Estate Agents Act 1976. The preferred model will also make provision for increased control over industry entry requirements such as education and training. It will set out a range of disclosure requirements, ensuring that where a conflict of interest arises it is disclosed to the consumer.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There will also be a range of measures designed to widen the offences and the sanctions and remedies that are available.</text>

        <para>
          <text>A new stand-alone regulatory body, independent of the industry, will be created called the Real Estate Agents Authority (the <def-term id="DLM1151920">Authority</def-term>).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Authority will be responsible for the licensing and registration of real estate agents and salespeople. It will be compulsory for all persons who work in the real estate agent industry in any of the categories listed below to be licensed. There would be 3 categories of licence—</text>

          <text>The authority will also be responsible for setting entry criteria for real estate agents and salespeople; approving new licence applications and applications for licence renewals; maintaining a public register of agents and salespeople; setting industry standards (codes); provision of consumer information; and first-tier complaints and discipline procedures.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Disciplinary Tribunal</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>A Real Estate Agents Disciplinary Tribunal will be established, within the Ministry of Justice, which will be responsible for making decisions on serious cases referred to it by the Authority.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Tribunal will have a range of penalties and remedies at its disposal, including the power to award compensation to consumers where it is satisfied that the person had suffered financial loss by reason of an act or omission by an agent. The Tribunal will have the power to order the interim suspension of an agent’s licence while it considers a case. It can also cancel an agent’s licence if it considers the person guilty of unsatisfactory conduct and impose a fine not exceeding $15,000 for individuals and $30,000 for a company.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Costs</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Government</emphasis>: The main cost to government will be costs associated with the primary legislative process to replace the existing Real Estate Agents Act 1976. There will also be set-up costs and administrative costs for the proposed Disciplinary Tribunal that will be established within the Ministry of Justice; however, it is proposed that these costs would be recovered by a levy on the industry.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Industry</emphasis>: The Real Estate Agents Authority will be funded entirely by the real estate industry. It is estimated that the Authority would cost $4.4 million per year to operate. The cost would be recovered from the annual licensing fee. There will be an additional cost for running the Disciplinary Tribunal, which will be operated by the Ministry of Justice. To cover the set-up costs of the Authority and the Tribunal, estimated at $1.5 million, it is proposed that the levy will be collected by the Authority and paid to the Crown. However, it is expected that the overall costs of the regulatory regime will fall as the cost will be off-set by the fact that there will no longer be compulsory membership of the REINZ.</text>

        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Government</emphasis>: The Government is likely to benefit from the continued healthy growth of the industry. Rogue agents will be identified and removed from the industry ensuring consumer confidence is restored. This will protect consumer housing wealth and the overall wealth of the country.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Industry</emphasis>: Setting up a complaints and disciplinary system that is transparent, accessible, and independent from the industry will restore consumer confidence and allow for the healthy growth of the industry. As the new system reduces the numbers of complaints about the industry it will provide an environment in which those agents and salespeople who act responsibly, within the rules and regulations of the industry, will be able to thrive.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
