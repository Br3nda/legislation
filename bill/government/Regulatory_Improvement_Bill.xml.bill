        <para>
          <text>This Bill is introduced under Standing Order 264(a). Standing Order 264(a) provides that a law reform or other omnibus Bill to amend more than one Act may be introduced if  the amendments deal with an interrelated topic that can be regarded as implementing a single broad policy. It is intended that the Bill will be divided into separate Bills at the committee of the whole House stage.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This Bill contains a number of amendments to legislation with the broad policy objectives of improving the regulatory framework and reducing the compliance burden on business. These amendments were identified as part of the Quality Regulation Review (the <emphasis style="bold">Review</emphasis>).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Overall these initiatives address regulatory duplication, gaps, administrative errors, and inconsistencies between different pieces of legislation that collectively create unnecessary compliance costs and uncertainty for business.  In keeping with the scope of the Review they target poor implementation and administration of various regulatory frameworks.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Individually these changes make small gains to improve the quality of specific regulatory environments. Once consolidated into the Regulatory Improvement Bill these many small gains can make a larger overall impact in removing barriers to economic growth. The choice of the Regulatory Improvement Bill also demonstrates the Government’s commitment to promptly addressing regulatory barriers to economic growth and transformation. A single Regulatory Improvement Bill is administratively more efficient to progress uncontroversial but important amendments identified by the Review.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill includes the following amendments.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Companies Act 1993</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The purpose of changes to the Companies Act 1993 is to reduce compliance costs and align the obligation for companies to appoint an auditor with recent changes to the Financial Reporting Act 1993.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Financial Reporting Act 1993 was amended in 2006 so that certain companies with overseas ownership are no longer required to file audited financial statements with the Registrar of Companies. However, these companies are still required to appoint an auditor under the Companies Act 1993, and are prohibited from electing to not appoint an auditor via a unanimous resolution of the shareholders (which most other companies are able to do).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The amendment to section 196 of the Companies Act 1993 provides that these companies may, via a unanimous resolution of shareholders, elect to not appoint an auditor.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Designs Act 1953</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The purpose of the Designs Act 1953 changes is to ensure the policy intent of the Act can be more efficiently and effectively achieved with minimum necessary compliance costs. This Bill aims to achieve this by allowing for the restoration of lapsed copyright in a registered design in circumstances where the lapse was as a result of an unintended failure to pay the renewal fee or to make the necessary application.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Fisheries Act 1996</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The purpose of amendments to the Fisheries Act 1996 is to create a statutory process whereby commercial fishers who have inadvertently incurred deemed value debts can have the debt reviewed. To date this problem can only be resolved through time-consuming administrative procedures, the outcomes of which provide little certainty for fishers. The Bill provides for the chief executive of the Ministry of Fisheries to consider requests from commercial fishers for catch balancing relief provided that set criteria are met.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Gas Act 1992</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The purpose of changes to the Gas Act 1992 is to create certainty that any regulations and rules that the Gas Industry Company Limited can recommend under Part 4A of the Gas Act 1992 will cover gas used as a feedstock. This can be achieved by amending section 3 of the Gas Act 1992.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The primary purpose of amendments to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Restructuring) Act 1995 is to remove the penalty regimes applicable under that Act for non-payment of cost recovery levies as the Fisheries Act 1996 contains an adequate penalty regime. The Bill proposes the removal of the penalty fees and the ability to deduct costs of collecting levies prescribed by sections 18 and 19 respectively of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Restructuring) Act 1995.</text>

          <text>The purpose of the Reserves Act 1977 changes is to reduce cost and administrative burden attaching to certain licences issued under the Act. To achieve this the Bill amends section 74(4) of the Reserves Act 1977 to allow for 10-year licences over vested reserves for the purposes in that section.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The purpose of changes to the Weights and Measures Act 1987 is to resolve the confusion and reduce compliance costs caused by having 2 pieces of legislation (the Weights and Measures Act 1987 and the Gas Act 1992) controlling the supply of LPG, in gaseous form, through pipes for industry consumers and regulators. The Bill proposes to remove the control of LPG in gaseous form from the Weights and Measures Act 1987.</text>

          <text>Commercial fishers are required to balance their catch with annual catch entitlement (<emphasis style="bold">ACE</emphasis>), as part of the quota management system (<emphasis style="bold">QMS</emphasis>).  If, at the end of a fishing year, they have not acquired enough ACE to balance against their catch they will incur a debt in the form of an invoice for annual deemed values.  End of year balancing (comparison of catch versus ACE) occurs approximately 20 days after the end of the fishing year.  On the 15th day after the end of a fishing year, however, the ACE register is closed, meaning that fishers are no longer able to transfer ACE and their ACE holdings at that point in time become fixed.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The majority of fishers manage to balance their catch within the required timeframes. However, since the introduction of the ACE balancing regime in 2001 there have been a number of cases where, for various administrative reasons, planned ACE transfers have failed to take place. In these cases, such failures only surface after the ACE register has closed, at which stage fishers are precluded from making additional ACE transfers to rectify the errors.  The fishers have then incurred an annual deemed value debt even though they had intended to comply with the law. In this type of situation most fishers have to pay the debt so as to prevent their commercial fishing permit from being suspended.  Currently there are no provisions in the Fisheries Act 1996 (the <emphasis style="bold">Act</emphasis>) to allow this type of situation to be rectified.</text>

                <text>It is proposed to amend section 97A of the HSNO Act to enable the enforcement agency responsible for the enforcement of the new organisms provisions of the HSNO Act (MAF) to use the cost recovery provisions of the Biosecurity Act 1993, including the cost options (section 135), levies (section 137), and regulations (section 165(1)(s)) to recover costs of performing HSNO functions in regard to new organism releases.  The existing Biosecurity (Costs) Regulations 2006, with any necessary amendments, could then be used for cost recovery.  This will be consistent with existing recovery of costs for performing HSNO functions in regard to new organism containment approvals.  This cost recovery model is more appropriate to the development of an efficient monitoring system for the holders of the approvals for various releases of new organisms, as the costs are more readily identified.</text>

The main impact will be that it will ensure that owners of registered designs have an opportunity to restore their design rights if they have lapsed through errors or oversights, which must be taken within the period prescribed in regulations. They will therefore not lose the exclusive rights to exploit a design that are granted by the registration of a design right, and will have a greater chance of recovering their investment in developing the design.  Those holders of design registrations who apply to restore their registrations will incur compliance costs in making the application, which are not considered to be substantial.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Feedstock gas is gas used as a raw material in a manufacturing process, such as the production of methanol.  Section 3(2)(d) of the Gas Act 1992 specifies that nothing in the Gas Act applies to “any gas used as a feedstock, excluding any gas being reformed for use as a gaseous fuel”. This wording was intended to exempt feedstock gas from the Act’s safety provisions, as safety of feedstock gas was covered under the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Part 4A of the Gas Act was added in 2004 to provide for the effective governance of the gas industry. The Gas Industry Company Limited is the industry body that can recommend regulations and rules under Part 4A to the Minister of Energy. As section 3(2)(d) was not altered at the time, it could be interpreted as exempting all users of feedstock gas from any rules or regulations made under Part 4A. There is no evidence of any intention to exclude feedstock gas from the governance regime. Significant consequences of such an exclusion could include that it may not be possible to enforce the terms of a gas emergency management plan against industry participants using feedstock gas, which would impact upon security of gas supply and the generation of electricity.  Also, some industry participants may be treated differently than others in respect of such things as open access to pipelines, consultation, and liability to pay the Gas Industry Company Limited’s levy.  The resulting lack of clarity could create unnecessary uncertainty for some gas industry participants.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Amend the Gas Act 1992 to clarify that feedstock gas is covered by the gas governance regime in Part 4A.  This would avoid any ambiguity around whether users of feedstock gas are subject to rules and regulations made under Part 4A, while retaining sufficient flexibility to exempt feedstock gas from those rules and regulations if required.  The initial policy intention of section 3(2)(d) would be unaffected from a safety perspective, because safety of feedstock gas would continue to be covered by the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992. The Gas Industry Company Limited would benefit from certainty in regard to many of the regulations and rules that it can recommend on various arrangements, especially those related to gas emergency arrangements.</text>

The Gas Industry Company Limited’s understanding is that all gas industry participants, including those that take gas for feedstock purposes, consider themselves to be bound by any regulations or rules made under Part 4A of the Gas Act 1992. Therefore, it is expected that the likely response from the industry would be supportive of this amendment because it provides certainty across the industry.</text>

          <text>The problem was identified as the result of an inquiry from an LPG supply company, which supports the proposal. The Energy Safety Service (which administers the Gas Act 1992) and the Measurement and Product Safety Service (which administers the Weights and Measures Act 1987) jointly developed the proposal. Consultation has been undertaken with the LPG Association of New Zealand, which supports the proposal. No formal public consultation has been completed because the proposed amendment is of a minor nature and will have no perceivable effect on the general public.</text>
