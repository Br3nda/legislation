Currently under the Act administering bodies can grant licences for communications facilities in reserves (section 48A), vary covenants, terms, and conditions in leases and licences (section 114), and consent to the transfer, sublease, or mortgage of leases and licences (section 115) only if the reserve concerned is vested in the administering body under section 26 of the Act. It was not intended that these powers be restricted to reserves of this type. Accordingly, the repeals effected by this clause will remedy the anomaly.</text>

However, the AITA prohibits the alienation of the whole or any part of the park. Accordingly, <emphasis style="italic">clause 8</emphasis> amends the land description of Albert Park by excluding from Schedule 1 the description of the land that corresponds to the land that ACC wishes to use for the art gallery. This has the effect that the land is no longer subject to the AITA and, therefore, no longer prohibited from alienation. <emphasis style="italic">Clause 9</emphasis> then amalgamates that land with the Auckland Art Gallery land and clarifies that it is no longer part of Albert Park or subject to the Reserves Act 1977.</text>

Accordingly, <emphasis style="italic">clause 14</emphasis> repeals the proviso to section (2) of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1957.

However, it is not entirely clear what the legal status of the land is, including whether it is subject to the Reserves Act 1977. Accordingly, <emphasis style="italic">clause 20</emphasis> declares the land to be vested in the Waitaki District Council as an endowment property for the purposes of aiding Waitaki District Council funds and states the land is an endowment property within the meaning of section 140(2) of the Local Government Act 2002 (and therefore able to be sold in accordance with sections 140 and 141 of that Act).</text>

The restriction was originally imposed under section 45 and Schedule 10 of the Reserves and other Lands Sale, Disposal, and Enabling and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1901, the enactment that granted the land to a predecessor of the Dunedin City Council, the Port Chalmers Borough Corporation. Despite the restriction, part of the reserve has been leased to the Port Chalmers Bowling Club Incorporated. Dunedin City Council wishes to repeal section 45 of the Reserves and other Lands Sale, Disposal, and Enabling and Public Bodies Empowering Act 1901 and manage and administer the Reserve subject only to the provisions of the Reserves Act 1977.

The area is a protected area under the Sugar Loaf Islands Marine Protected Area Act 1991 (the <emphasis style="bold">Act</emphasis>). Section 7 of the Act deemed the protected area to be a conservation area under the Conservation Act 1987 and divided it into sanctuary areas and a conservation park. The protected area is currently a mixture of Crown-owned and local authority-owned land and seabed. The Crown wishes to rectify the anomalous position of having sanctuary areas and a conservation park owned in part by persons other than the Crown, designate further areas within the protected area as sanctuary areas, and remove the (redundant) wildlife refuge status from further areas within the protected area. Accordingly, <emphasis style="italic">clause 43</emphasis> transfers the fee simple estate in specified pieces of land or seabed to the Crown. In addition, the transfers are treated, for the purposes of the local authorities concerned, as satisfying any requirements under the Local Government Act 2002, or any other relevant enactment, in respect of the transfer of land by a local authority, and<emphasis style="italic"> clause 44</emphasis> amends the Act to designate specified areas as sanctuary areas, and removes wildlife refuge status from other areas.</text>

Dunedin City Council now wishes to transfer to a community trust some of the land that is still required for the purposes of an aerodrome. Accordingly, <emphasis style="italic">clause 46</emphasis> amends section 9 of the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act 1973 to authorise the transfer of specified land to the Taieri Airport Trust so long as the Council obtains the written consent of the Minister of Transport before doing so.</text>

In 1995, the Waitakere City Council, without lawful authority, disposed of the land to a local authority trading enterprise. The local authority trading enterprise in turn subdivided the land and sold it to private owners as fee simple titles. Most of the land is now developed with residential buildings erected on it. However, because the titles to the land were created by an invalid process, and contrary to section 112 of the Reserves Act 1977, the land retains its reserve status and remains subject to that Act. Accordingly, <emphasis style="italic">clause 49</emphasis> revokes the reserve status of the land and validates the dealings of the private owners.</text>

The land was originally held in trust by the Te Awamutu Borough Council for itself and four other local authorities for afforestation and water conservation purposes and as a scenic reserve. As a result of dealings between the parties, changes in local government organisation, and changes to the status of the land, the legal and beneficial interest in the land now resides solely with the Waipa District Council with the land classified as a reserve for afforestation and water conservation purposes. Waipa District Council wishes to have the title to the land reflect this.

Currently three trustees are appointed for life and responsibility for their replacement lies with the Minister of Conservation. Accordingly, <emphasis style="italic">clause 57</emphasis> amends the Winton Racecourse Reserve Management Ordinance 1873 by repealing and substituting the trustee provision. <emphasis style="italic">Clause 58</emphasis> is a transitional provision that applies to current trustees and limits their term of appointment to three years from the commencement of this Act.</text>
