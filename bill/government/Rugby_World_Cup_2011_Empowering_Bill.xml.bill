        <heading>Introduction</heading>
        <para>
          <text>The purpose of this bill is to allow consent and regulatory approvals for temporary activities related to the Rugby World Cup 2011 (RWC) to be considered expediently to align with the tournament schedule. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A Rugby World Cup Authority would be created as a consenting body to determine applications for temporary approvals and temporary declarations of permitted activities. The Minister for the Rugby World Cup would be empowered to grant urgent approvals for temporary activities and facilities, and to recommend that the Governor-General declare, by Order in Council, permitted activities that were deemed reasonably necessary for the successful staging of the tournament. </text>

        <heading>Commencement</heading>
        <para>
          <text>As introduced, most of the bill would come into force on the day after it received the Royal assent. This leaves insufficient time to appoint the Authority, establish working arrangements with councils, make regulations regarding forms, and establish payment arrangements for deposits. We recommend that clause 2 of the bill be amended so that parts 1, 2, and 6 would come into force the day after it received the Royal assent, and parts 3 and 5 would come into force 28 days after it received the Royal assent. All of part 4 of the bill should come into force on 1 July 2011. </text>

        <heading>Definitional changes: clause 4</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend amendments to the definition of the Rugby World Cup 2011 and the introduction of a new definition of the Rugby World Cup 2011 tournament or tournament, to distinguish clearly between the tournament and the games that it comprises on one hand, and the ancillary events that support the tournament on the other. These definitions are reflected appropriately throughout the bill.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend that the definition of ancillary events be clarified in clause 4 so that these events include, for example, live public screenings of games. Many people other than those who have tickets may wish to watch games live at public screenings. There also may be community events that ought to be included in this definition, as they are likely to enhance the public’s enjoyment of the tournament.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend that the definition of public notice under clause 4 be amended to allow such notice to be given on the internet, but so that it may also be given by other means such as newspapers and radio. We also recommend amendments to clauses 25(1)(d), 25(1)(g) 32(5)(a) and (b), 60(6), and 89 so that the Authority could carry out many of its functions electronically. This would allow costs to be reduced more effectively and allow the Authority to work more efficiently. </text>

          <heading>Public health emergencies</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We are concerned that the bill should not limit or affect Acts which are important to ensure, as far as possible, that the RWC does not endanger the health and safety of the public. We recommend, therefore, that the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002, the Burial and Cremation Act 1964, and the Coroners Act 2006 should be added to the list of Acts in clause 5(1) that this bill does not limit or affect. </text>

          <heading>Land Transport Management Act 2003</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend that the Land Transport Management Act 2003, which concerns the funding of land transport, be added to the definition of transport legislation in clause 5(4), which is excluded from part 3 of the bill. </text>
          </para>

        <comm.lev2>
          <heading>Building Act 2004</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend inserting new clause 5A into the bill, to make it clear that, despite the restrictions imposed by the Building Act 2004, a short-term lease of an apartment for the duration of the RWC would not qualify as a change of use, as long as the building had gained approval under the Act since June 2001, and met certain conditions regarding fire-safety requirements. We have added a requirement that anyone letting out their apartment must have or install a smoke alarm and evacuation notices. </text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>A change of use, even if it were possible to process in the time available, would be likely to entail a requirement that owners wanting to let out their apartments to short-term visitors meet the hotel-like standards imposed on transient accommodation. This would affect the quantity of accommodation available during the RWC and could result in a shortage in accommodation. </text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>These requirements do not apply to stand-alone residences, only to household units, as defined in the Building Act, that form part of a building. This is because using stand-alone residences for transient accommodation during the RWC does not trigger a change of use under sections 114 and 115 of the Act, so they do not need the exemption from that Act. </text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>We encourage councils and people letting their residences during the RWC to advertise that accommodation of this kind may not have the disabled access normally expected in transient accommodation. </text>

        <heading>Declaration of the Rugby World Cup as a major maritime event</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend that new clause 5B be inserted to provide that RWC events on, over, or adjacent to water can be declared by the Minister of Transport, on the application of the New Zealand Police or regional council, to be major maritime events under section 200A of the Maritime Transport Act 1994. This would allow police to exercise special enforcement powers to create an exclusion zone in designated areas. The Police consider that such powers are necessary to ensure the safety and security of RWC-related activities.</text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Public health and safety</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We consider that the bill should include specific measures to protect public health and safety as far as practicable, and recommend that clause 9 be amended to specify that in exercising its functions under the bill the Authority must have regard to the need to ensure that public health and safety are protected. In addition we recommend that clauses 19 and 20 be redrafted to insert requirements for applications to the Authority under clauses 16(1) or (2) and 17 to include information on how the applicant would ensure the safety of people carrying out the activity or using the facility in question. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Clause 51(3)(c) should be amended to require the Minister to have regard to the need to secure public safety when determining the conditions that applied to urgent approvals. </text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Powers of the Authority</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend amending clause 10(2) to ensure that, in addition to the full powers given to the Authority in subclause (1), it would also have the same powers as the relevant statutory person or body would have if applications were made under the usual legislation. </text>
        </para>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Role of administrative secretariat</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend that the role of the administrative secretariat, and its interaction with the Authority, be clarified, by the amendments detailed below. </text>
        </para>
        <comm.lev2>
          <heading>Administrative secretariat to check applications and provide advice</heading>
          <para>
            <text>To enable the administrative secretariat to check that applications include all the necessary information, and make the best use of the skills and experience of the local authority staff that would make up the administrative secretariat, we recommend that clause 15(3) be amended to require the administrative secretariat to include both advisory and administrative staff.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend inserting new clauses 15(4)(ba) and (bb) to state that a function of the administrative secretariat is to provide advice and reports for the Authority when requested, even on matters for which the territorial authority is not the normal statutory decision-maker. These inserted clauses would make it clear that the administrative secretariat would act at all times in accordance with the instructions of the Authority and could not act on its own authority. </text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend amending clause 3(1) in Schedule 1 to allow the Authority to delegate to the administrative secretariat the power to require information or expert advice. We also recommend that clause 11 of Schedule 1 be amended to clarify what kind of expert advice the Authority can request, and from whom. </text>
          </para>
        </comm.lev2>
        <comm.lev2>
          <heading>Usual decision-maker may comment on applications</heading>
          <para>
            <text>When deciding on an application the Authority would be required to consider whether the applicant had taken all reasonably practical measures to obtain an approval under the statutory regime that would otherwise apply, and that the approval could not be obtained in time under that regime. The bill as introduced would not give the usual decision-maker the power to contribute to decisions on applications, even though its experience and expertise would assist the Authority. We recommend that clause 15(4)(b) be amended to include an obligation, if a usual decision-maker exists, for the administrative secretariat to send a copy of the application to them. This amendment should make it easier for statutory persons or bodies to make submissions on applications under clause 26.</text>

        <comm.lev2>
          <heading>Deposit </heading>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend moving clause 21 into Part 2, as clause 15A, as the deposit clause applies to all aspects of the bill, not just part 3. </text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>As introduced, the bill leaves open how the deposit would be set, and when it would be paid. New clause 15A would clarify the setting of deposits, allowing the administrative secretariat to determine the deposit in accordance with regulations and instructions from the chairperson of the Authority. It should make it clear that the deposit would contribute to the overheads of the Authority and the administrative secretariat, and that the application process would be complete and ready for processing only once the deposit was received in full.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend an amendment to clause 88 to allow the Governor-General to make regulations prescribing the method for calculating the deposit.</text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Existing applications</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend inserting a new clause to clarify the status of an application made under the bill for the same activity or matter for which an application had been made, which was not yet determined, under the legislation that would otherwise apply. New clause 21A provides that an application to the Authority would stop the processing of any existing application, and require the existing paperwork on the application to be transferred to the Authority. This option would permit applicants to switch to the new jurisdiction and promote speedier consideration of applications.</text>

        <heading>Preliminary consideration of applications regarding match venues</heading>
        <para>
          <text>Before the Authority could consider an application under the bill it must be satisfied that the applicant had taken all practicable measures to use the normal statutory processes to obtain the required approvals. This has raised concern that because of an oversight or management failure a crucial element of infrastructure might not receive the necessary consent. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend inserting new clause 22A to require the Authority to disregard the tests under clause 22(3)(b) and (c) if the activity or facility is, because it relates to a tournament venue, essential for the proper conduct of the tournament. </text>
        </para>
      </comm.lev1>
      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Preliminary decision </heading>
        <para>
          <text>In the bill as introduced the Authority would have to make a preliminary decision on whether it could properly consider an application within five working days of receipt. This might be impossible if the Authority was still waiting for further information from the applicant. Clause 23 should be amended, therefore, to extend the time limit for giving notice of the preliminary decision when the Authority has sought further information, to five working days after the receipt of the information requested. </text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Ambush marketing </heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend that clause 24(1)(b) be amended to require the Authority to provide Rugby New Zealand 2011 Limited (RNZ) with a copy of all applications received. This is to ensure that RNZ would be notified of activities or facilities being considered under the bill so that where appropriate it could take steps under other legislation, such as the Major Events Management Act 2007. We recommend inserting clauses 32(1)(d) and (2)(d), to require the Authority to also provide RNZ with copies of its determinations. We considered a request by RNZ that the Authority would ensure that the Major Events Management Act was complied with by applicants. We are of the view that it is not the role of the Authority to enforce that Act and accordingly do not recommend this step. </text>

        <heading>Fire service to receive notice of applications</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We are concerned about fire safety in relation to applications under parts 3 and 5 of the bill. We recommend that the New Zealand Fire Service be notified of each application made to the Authority for an approval under part 3 or a liquor licence under part 5. This would ensure that the fire service could provide information to the Authority on matters relating to fire safety, and the Authority would have to take this information into account when determining the applications.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend amending clauses 24(1)(b) and 60(6) so that the fire service and the chief executive of the fire service would have to be provided with a copy of all applications received by the Authority; and that clause 26(1)(e) be inserted to allow the fire service to make submissions on all applications. The Authority should also be required to provide the fire service with notice of its determination when an application is not publicly notified, so we recommend also inserting new clause 32(1)(c).</text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Status of local plans and bylaws</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend amending clause 16(1) to include statutory planning instruments (such as plans and bylaws) to ensure that approvals could be sought for activities and facilities that were regulated under such instruments, not just those regulated by primary legislation. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Clauses 30 and 31 should also be amended to make it clear that the Authority could not grant an approval or declaration for an activity or facility which would be prohibited under any other Act, though this would not extend to instruments such as local plans or bylaws. </text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Authority power to require cleanup-bond</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend amending clauses 30(6)(b), 31(6)(b), 47(2)(b), 50(2)(b), and 73(3) to give the Authority the explicit power to impose a cleanup bond on an applicant. This would cover rectification costs if an applicant did not restore facilities satisfactorily. </text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Adverse effects</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend amending clauses 30(1) and 31(1) to require the Authority to consider possible adverse effects to the environment that would be more than minor if a licence were granted. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Clause 28 should be moved to subpart 3 as clause 31A, as it applies to the assessment of adverse effects on the environment; the Authority must make such an assessment in determining applications under clauses 30 and 31, rather than in determining who has standing to make submissions under clause 27.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend that new clause 31(6) be inserted to allow the Authority to impose such conditions as it considers appropriate on approvals and declarations, which should minimise detrimental effects.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend that clause 49(e) be amended to require the Governor-General to have regard to any adverse effects of an RWC activity when making regulations under clause 48. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>We consider that clause 51(c) should be amended to require the Minister to have regard to adverse effects when determining urgent approvals. </text>

      <comm.lev1>
        <heading>Commencement of approvals and declarations</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend that clause 33 be amended so that approvals and declarations would commence on the third working day after the determination of the Authority was publicly notified, unless the Authority specified a later date. This would give people time to obtain an interim injunction should they wish to appeal a decision of the Authority.</text>

          <heading>Continuation of approvals granted under the bill</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend that clause 36 provide only for a certificate to be applied for and granted to recognise that an RWC approval complies with the requirements of the legislation that would normally apply to the relevant activity or facility.  </text>

        <heading>Rugby World Cup liquor licences</heading>
        <para>
          <text>We recommend that the definition of approval in clause 4 be amended to exclude RWC liquor licences expressly. This should ensure that under clause 36 approvals for liquor licenses will not be allowed to continue after the tournament. </text>
        </para>
        <comm.lev2>
          <heading>Cruise ships</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend that for clarification, the definition of a ship for the purposes of part 5 of the bill be inserted into clause 57, and that a ship be included in the definition of premises. We consider that clause 61(1)(a)(ii), allowing the Authority to grant RWC liquor licences for ships while in New Zealand waters, and clause 63(3)(c), allowing the Authority to determine applications for one or more ships, should be inserted. </text>

          <heading>Club licences</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend that clause 59(1)(b) and (c) be inserted, to allow existing club licence holders and chartered clubs to apply for RWC liquor licences, and that a definition of a permanent club charter be inserted into clause 57.</text>

          <heading>Requirement for match venues to have licences </heading>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend that new subclause 59(1A) be inserted to require RWC match venues to hold RWC liquor licences in order to sell liquor during the tournament. This would ensure consistency of conditions at match venues, and would also give the Police greater enforcement powers than are available under a Sale of Liquor Act 1989 (SOLA) licence.</text>

          <heading>Suspension of Sale Of Liquor Act licences</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend that clause 59 be amended to clarify that the suspension of a SOLA licence would continue for the duration of an RWC liquor licence as granted, notwithstanding any order made to vary, suspend, or cancel the RWC liquor licence. This would clarify that a venue could not continue to sell alcohol under a SOLA licence in the event of an RWC licence being cancelled or suspended.</text>

          <heading>Liquor licences and special licences under the Sale Of Liquor Act </heading>
          <para>
            <text>We have noted that under the SOLA special licence regime applications to extend hours for the live screening of other tournament matches have been declined on the grounds that such a screening does not constitute a special event within the meaning of SOLA. This illustrates the need to amend the definition of ancillary events in clause 4, making it clear that such screenings are events that would qualify for an RWC liquor licence. </text>

          <para>
            <text>In the interests of protecting public safety, we recommend that new clause 60(3)(da) be inserted to require an applicant for an RWC liquor licence to include information on how entry to and exit from premises or an area that has an RWC liquor licence are to be controlled for public safety. </text>

          <heading>Concurrent Applications</heading>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend that new clause 60A be inserted to make it clear that applications under parts 3 and 5 of the bill could be lodged and processed concurrently and considered by the Authority together. We also recommend inserting new subclause 71(3), specifying that in the case of concurrent applications, an RWC liquor licence must not be issued until all the necessary approvals have been granted. This would ensure the other application was taken into account by the Authority, and would mean that a liquor licence could not be granted for a facility or activity that did not get approved. </text>

            <text>We recommend moving clause 66, as clause 63A, to clarify that the matters described in the clause are relevant both to objections to, and determinations of, applications.

          </para>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend inserting clause 73(3A), which provides that if the holder of a club or chartered licence holder applies for an RWC licence the Authority can restrict whom alcohol may be served to. </text>

            <text>We recommend the insertion of new clause 73A which would state that the hours class four gambling machines can be operated are aligned with the SOLA liquor licence hours, not the RWC licence hours of a premises. We see the possibility of increased gambling hours as an unintended consequence of the bill, which as introduced allows class four gambling machines on premises to be operated for the increased opening hours granted under an RWC liquor licence.</text>

          <heading>Powers of inspectors and constables in relation to licences</heading>
          <para>
            <text>Police have the power to order the closure of licensed premises under the SOLA, but such an order cannot be extended beyond the day it was made (that is, beyond midnight on that day). However, for most outlets serving alcohol, a working day may extend past midnight. We recommend that clauses 76 and 81 be amended so that if necessary the closure of RWC-licensed premises can continue beyond midnight on the day the order was made and into the next day.</text>

          <heading>Licence cancellation or suspension </heading>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend that new subclause 77(7) be inserted to specify which individuals the Authority would be required to notify when an order affecting a licence had been made. This would involve notifying the inspector or constable who applied for an order that the conditions of a licence had changed. </text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>Under clause 77(6) the Authority could suspend or cancel an RWC licence because of a serious breach of licence conditions without the licensee having the opportunity to be heard. As introduced the bill has no provision for such a licensee to appeal the decision. We recommend that clause 77(6) be deleted, and replaced by new clause 77A, which would allow a licensee affected by a decision made without notice to apply to have the decision set aside.  </text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend that clause 79 be amended to allow a Medical Officer of Health or member of the fire service to immediately suspend or vary the conditions of a licence because of public health or fire safety concerns. </text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <text>We recommend that clause 87, regarding appeals to the High Court on questions of law against decisions of the Authority, be extended to allow individuals to appeal suspensions or cancellations of licences or manager’s certificates or any variation of their conditions.  </text>

          <text>The bill includes powers to promulgate regulations to permit non-compliance with normal processes in time-constrained circumstances. The power in the bill enables the Minister to ignore the recommendation of the Authority and substitute another decision instead. Labour members believe the Minister’s power should be limited to accepting or rejecting the recommendation of the Authority. </text>
