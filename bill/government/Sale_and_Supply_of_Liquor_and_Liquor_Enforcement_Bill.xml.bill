          <text>This Bill proposes to amend the Sale of Liquor Act 1989, the Summary Offences Act 1981, and the Land Transport Act 1998, to implement recommendations arising from the Review of the Sale and Supply of Liquor to Minors and the Review of the Sale of Liquor and Liquor Enforcement Issues (the <def-term id="DLM1478502">Targeted Review</def-term>).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill also introduces into the Sale of Liquor Act 1989 a new system of enforced self-regulation of alcohol advertising arising out of the Review of the Regulation of Alcohol Advertising.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Objectives</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>In seeking to address the drinking behaviours of minors an integrated approach is necessary. Solutions rely on changing the behaviour of individuals and communities. This involves a supportive regulatory environment, public awareness and ownership of issues, understanding of rights and responsibilities, and consistent and effective enforcement. Improving compliance by industry will also make a contribution. The proposals in the Bill are intended to contribute to this change.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Research indicates that parents are the main suppliers of alcohol to minors (60% of minors identify parents as the primary source of supply). Around 30% of supply is by friends and 10 to 15% is purchased from licensed premises by minors themselves. In the context of these findings, the large majority (92%) of parents agree that the primary responsibility for helping teenagers learn how to handle alcohol responsibly belongs to parents.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Common locations where minors consume alcohol are their own home, someone else’s home and public places.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There is also increasing concern regarding the extent of alcohol-related harm, and communities are frustrated by their inability to manage that harm. There is a need to improve local control over where, to whom, when, and how alcohol can be sold in communities, to ensure that social impact is taken into account in licensing conditions.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Inexperienced drivers are particularly at risk of alcohol-related crashes. These proposals aim to make it clear to young, inexperienced drivers that alcohol and driving do not mix. So there can be no doubt, drivers aged under 20 years who do not have a full licence will have an alcohol limit of zero.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Enforced self-regulation of alcohol advertising</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>A review of the current voluntary self-regulatory system for alcohol advertising found a small but significant association between the level of exposure to alcohol advertising and alcohol consumption. The review recommended improvements to move to a system of enforced self-regulation. This Bill proposes a new legislative system that outlines the public policy goals of the proposed system, roles of the responsible body, and offences and sanctions.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Executive summary</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>A review of the current self-regulatory system for alcohol advertising found an association between the level of exposure to alcohol advertising and alcohol consumption. It recommended improvements to move to a system of enforced self-regulation through providing a legislative system in line with international best practice for alcohol advertising regulation. The preferred option is that the enhanced system is implemented through amendments to the Sale of Liquor Act 1989 alongside non-legislative actions for government agencies and industry. The main impacts arising from this proposal are that a wider range of types of advertising will be regulated, and the legislative framework and sanctions will mean there is a greater expectation that advertisements comply with the Code(s) for Advertising Liquor.</text>

        <para>
          <text>An expert multi-disciplinary Steering Group reviewed the self-regulatory system for alcohol advertising. It considered a broad range of evidence and concluded that alcohol advertising plays a role in shaping the culture of drinking, and that it reflects and amplifies drinking practices in the context of a country’s social, economic and cultural history. The evidence suggests a small but statistically significant association between the level of exposure to alcohol advertising and the level and patterns of alcohol consumption.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Steering Group’s public consultation on alcohol advertising regulation elicited a range of feedback from stakeholders. Some stakeholders argued that alcohol advertising has some benefits, including sponsorship of community and sports groups and events and the provision of information to consumers. Other stakeholders identified harms from alcohol advertising including contributing to harmful drinking patterns, particularly among youth and people recovering from alcohol dependence, linking alcohol to desirable behaviour, and promoting the positive side of alcohol use without balancing these with the negative consequences.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Currently alcohol advertising is regulated by a self-regulatory system administered by the industry-funded Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The ASA has a voluntary Code for Advertising Liquor (CAL) and its Advertising Standards Complaints Board (ASCB) resolves complaints alleging breaches of the CAL. On receipt of a complaint, the ASA considers whether the relevant advertisement breaches the CAL. Where a breach is determined the ASA may request the advertiser to withdraw the advert.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Although the current system compares well against international standards and has a number of strengths, several features of an effective regulatory framework for alcohol advertising are lacking or insufficient. Therefore a move to enforced self-regulation is recommended through a package of improvements to the existing system.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Objectives</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The review considered alcohol advertising regulation options against criteria of effectiveness, efficiency and fairness. Effectiveness was tested against the Government’s alcohol policy goals: minimising alcohol-related harm and reducing inequalities; changing the drinking culture; and minimising the exposure of young people to alcohol marketing messages.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Alternative options</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>In addition to the status quo (outlined above) and the preferred option of enforced self-regulation outlined below, the review considered moving to co-regulation or government regulation of alcohol advertising. The options differ as to the level of regulatory oversight of alcohol advertising.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Option 1: Co-regulation of alcohol advertising</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Co-regulation involves a government agency with specific statutory functions that might include adjudicating on appeals against rulings of the body that considers advertising complaints, appointing a proportion of the members of the body that considers advertising complaints and approving the advertising codes.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Co-regulation is similarly effective to the preferred option plus it has advantages of a higher level of government control and accountability and more opportunity for engagement between key stakeholders. However, it also has the disadvantages of some reduction in the level of industry compliance and <quote.in quote="1">good will</quote.in> and some loss of flexibility and fast-paced decision-making. It is less efficient than the preferred option because it is more costly, with some costs shifted to government, and is administratively complex, possibly requiring the creation of a new agency. It is comparable to the preferred option in terms of fairness.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Option 2: Full government regulation of alcohol advertising</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Government regulation would require legislated rules for alcohol advertising. A government agency would be responsible for many of the functions and processes currently undertaken by self-regulatory organisations, particularly monitoring and reviews. Infringements of the rules would be punishable primarily by fines administered by the government agency.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Government regulation would have some benefits for effectiveness, including reduced exposure to children and young people in traditional media, enabling wide extension of coverage, and improved monitoring and research ensuring future issues would be addressed. Disadvantages with respect to effectiveness are that it may displace advertising to methods that are harder to regulate, that future issues may be addressed more slowly, that flexibility and pace of decision-making would be compromised, and that loopholes would be exploited increasingly as technology progresses. Government regulation is the most costly, significantly shifts costs from industry to government, and is administratively complex. This option may also raise issues under the Bill of Rights Act 1990.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Preferred option: enforced self-regulation</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Enforced self-regulation is similar to the status quo but changes would be made to strengthen and improve the existing self-regulatory system, including a legislative system. It would ensure a greater role for government, wider coverage, systematic monitoring and research, independent auditing, and strengthening compliance incentives by introducing new <quote.in quote="1">back stop</quote.in> enforcement measures in legislation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Enforced self-regulation is preferred because it has benefits for effectiveness, efficiency and fairness over the other options considered. It retains the current system’s flexibility and fast-paced decision-making, will have a good level of industry participation and compliance, will ensure deliberate non-compliers are held to account if legislative enforcement power is included, gives an increased opportunity for government influence, facilitates wide extension of coverage, ensures emerging and future issues are addressed through improved monitoring and research, reduces the exposure of children and young people, has the potential for wider restrictions on placement and volume of advertisements, is a relatively low-cost model, and is less to lead to severe restrictions with respect to the Bill of Rights Act 1990.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The disadvantages of the preferred option are that it is more complex than the status quo, risks reduced industry engagement and <quote.in quote="1">good will</quote.in>, and increases compliance costs for the industries involved. There would be moderate cost increases to government.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Steps to mitigate the major risks have been incorporated in the policy proposal. The risk that the responsible body will not refer cases of serious or persistent non-compliance to the Crown for prosecution will be mitigated by ongoing monitoring of the outcomes of the system and the option for prosecution regardless of the responsible body’s decision if necessary. The risk of the system failing to deliver on its public policy goals will be mitigated by reviewing progress after two years. The risk of reduced industry engagement limiting effectiveness will be mitigated by investing in engaging with industry to improve compliance. The risk that increased compliance costs reduce industry cooperation will be mitigated by government funding of proactive investigation to reduce costs to the responsible body and its members.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option does not affect the stock of regulation because alcohol advertising is currently self-regulated. A move to enforced self-regulation brings the alcohol advertising regulation closer to the system for the regulation of broadcast programming, which is a co-regulatory system through the Broadcasting Act 1989.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Implementation and review</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>An amendment to the Sale of Liquor Act 1989 will be required to implement the proposals. The Ministry of Health will engage with the responsible body (i.e. the ASA) and arrange a memorandum of understanding to ensure that all expectations for compliance are explicit. Public health units will work with industry to assist it to comply with new requirements. Along with the responsible body, Public Health Units and District Licensing Agencies will contribute to enforcement, particularly by referring cases of suspected breaches to the responsible body. There may be an increase in costs to the responsible body depending on the volume of complaints under the extended system. This is likely to result in increased compliance costs for industry.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The responsible body will be expected to conduct internal process monitoring and to arrange independent audit. The Ministry of Health will be responsible for research and outcomes monitoring, including developing and implementing indicators to ensure the system is meeting its goals. The system will be reviewed after two years of operation.</text>

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Consultation</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The results of public consultation via written submissions, hui and fono were considered during the alcohol advertising review as part of the analysis leading to the final conclusions and recommendations of the Steering Group. A youth version of the consultation document was used to encourage youth input. The Ministry of Health received 252 submissions from a side variety of individuals, liquor and advertising industry representatives, researchers, regulatory bodies, the health sector and sponsored groups. The Report of the Steering Group for the Review of the Regulation of Alcohol Advertising was published in May 2007. Stakeholders were invited to provide further feedback on the Steering Group’s recommendations at this stage. In total, 26 submissions were received. The main findings were that industry prefers full self-regulation but generally supports the review’s recommendations, while members of the public, researchers, and the public health and social sectors would prefer a greater level of government regulation.</text>

          <text>New Zealand has a permissive drinking environment with particular concern around the social supply of liquor to minors, and unsupervised drinking by minors in large quantities. Overall, the level of compliance by industry is good, however some licensed premises continue to sell liquor to minors. An effective government response needs to be multi-faceted and comprehensive, in line with the approach taken for similar problems such as childhood obesity and smoking. An integrated package of responses is required, including not only amendments to the Sale of Liquor Act 1989, but also non-legislative action.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Non-regulatory options</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The research shows that legal restrictions on the sale and supply of liquor to minors, while necessary, must be complemented by effective enforcement and efforts to change attitudes. Therefore non-regulatory options such as communication and the provision of information form part of the package of policy responses to the issues identified. However, if implemented as isolated strategies, these approaches will not be sufficient for lasting behavioural change. Most of the proposed reforms therefore require legislative change.</text>

        <para>
          <text>There may be some compliance costs for licensees from two proposals. This first will impact on licensed premises who persistently sell to minors.

        <para>
          <text>The second proposal that may involve financial costs for licensees is to limit defences when a sale to a minor is made. A mandatory age identification regime was considered but rejected due to the cost implications for businesses and consumers. Instead, an option to limit the reasonable defence belief was adopted where the sole defence is proof that an approved form of age identification has been sighted. This option involves lower compliance costs while creating an incentive for businesses to ensure they have systems in place to prevent the sale of liquor to minors.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Problem</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Alcohol-related harm is a social problem. There are concerns about the increased number of liquor outlets (particularly off-licence outlets) since the 1999 amendment, which allowed supermarkets and grocery stores to sell wine and beer.  Recent studies have shown that increased availability of alcohol is connected with harm, including alcohol-related trauma, injuries and violence.  Police Alco-Link data shows that 31% to 59% of all alleged offenders and 32% to 68% of all alleged violent offenders had consumed alcohol prior to arrest. An ALAC study indicates there are about 350,000 binge drinkers in New Zealand [Ref: Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand (2004). Are you a binge drinker? Acohol.org.nz, vol. 4, no. 4.].  Binge drinking can cause additional health and social problems. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The 1999 amendment explicitly prohibited the sale of liquor from dairies.  However, there is a difference between how the respective District Licensing Agencies consider licensing these types of premises and there is no clear legal definition distinguishing a dairy from a grocery store.  As a result, many dairies have been able to obtain a liquor licence under the Sale of Liquor Act.   </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Enforcement proceedings against grocery stores holding off-licences represent 15% of the 878 licence applications determined by the Liquor Licensing Authority since 2003.  In addition, the Liquor Licensing Authority determined 132 applications that sought to suspend or cancel a liquor licence held by these types of premises, of which 122 licences were suspended from one day to three months, three licences were cancelled and seven applications were dismissed without a suspension or cancellation ordered.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>While the types of liquor that can be sold from supermarkets and grocery stores is restricted to wine, beer, mead and cider, there have been recent applications by these premises to expand the types of liquor sold using a “store within a store” concept (e.g. a bottle store operating within a supermarket).  In addition, liquor stores have started expanding the range of products that they sell beyond alcohol.  This is circumventing the intention of the Act to restrict the nature of the business and sales from these premises and needs to be clarified.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Communities have expressed frustration at the harm caused by the proliferation of outlets.  Greater community input is needed at the licensing stage, to ensure that the needs of the community are taken into account.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Adequacy statement</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Ministry of Justice confirms that the principles of the Code of Good Regulatory Practice and the regulatory impact analysis requirements, including the consultation requirements, have been complied with in developing the preferred option.  The Ministry considers this Regulatory Impact Statement to be adequate.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Objectives</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The object of the Sale of Liquor Act 1989 is to provide a reasonable system of control over the sale and supply of liquor, while contributing to the reduction of liquor abuse, as far as that can be achieved through legislative means.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Alternative objectives</explnote.subhead1>
        <explnote.subhead2>Community input into licensing decisions</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>One of the concerns that has arisen is that the licensing process is not sufficiently flexible to meet individual communities’ needs. Territorial authorities can develop alcohol plans to better manage the availability of alcohol in their communities. Although it appears that such plans have, on occasion, been taken into account by licensing authorities, the plans do not actually have any legal standing under the Sale of Liquor Act.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>To ensure that Local Alcohol Plans allow the community a genuine means of exercising a measure of control and influence over the type, number, and operating hours of outlets in their area, they must be given some official status. Making it mandatory to for territorial authorities to have a Local Alcohol Plan would ensure communities had greater control over the availability of alcohol in their area.  However, it would create a considerable compliance burden, and Local Alcohol Plans will not be necessary or useful in all communities. The preferred option is to make having such a plan optional, but require licensing decision-makers to give effect to a plan if there is one.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A further aspect of giving communities greater control over local licensing decisions is ensuring that there is an effective opportunity to consider the social impact of a proposed licence.  However, making social impact assessments mandatory for all licence applications would create a significant compliance burden that is unlikely to be justified in all cases. The preferred option is to allow communities to decide in their Local Alcohol Plan, if they have one, whether and when a social impact assessment is required.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Off licences</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Sale of Liquor Act prohibits dairies from holding off-licenses and only allows supermarkets to sell beer, wine, mead and cider pursuant to an off-licence.  It appears that applicants have been finding or looking for ways to circumvent this underlying policy. Because the current legislation appears to be ineffective in achieving the underlying policy of the Act, the only realistic option is to amend the Act to clarify what that policy is. The preferred option is, therefore, to amend the Sale of Liquor Act.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In relation to dairies, the difficulty is that dairies are obtaining liquor licences by arguing that they are in fact <quote.in quote="1">grocery stores</quote.in>.  The current definition of <quote.in quote="1">grocery store</quote.in> in the Sale of Liquor Act therefore appears to be inadequate.  The most effective means of ensuring that dairies are excluded is by introducing a minimum size for outlets.  Introducing a minimum size of 300 square metres was considered, but was thought to be larger than was actually necessary to capture the targeted outlets. Supplementing the definition of <quote.in quote="1">grocery store</quote.in> with a lower size limit of 150 square metres is the preferred option.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In relation to supermarkets, the concern is that they are seeking to get around the prohibition on selling alcohol other than beer, wine, mead and cider by setting up adjacent <quote.in quote="1">stores</quote.in> or <quote.in quote="1">store within a store</quote.in> arrangements.  Because the current legislation appears to be ineffective in achieving the underlying policy of the Act, the only realistic option is to amend the Act to clarify what that policy is.  It is also necessary to amend the Act to ensure that there is no loop hole that will allow the underlying policy to be avoiding by letting liquor stores diversify into selling groceries.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Changes to the types of premises that can hold liquor licences are expected to reduce the availability of liquor, through reducing the number of liquor outlets.  Research supports a reduction in the availability of alcohol. In particular, research suggests that these changes are likely to result in a reduction in the number of violent offences in that area, and alcohol-related harm arising in University areas.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Requiring effect to be given to a local alcohol plan (if developed), changing the criteria for an objection to a licence application and requiring the development and consideration of social impact statements will allow greater opportunity for community input and a wider of range of factors to be taken into account in licensing decisions. This is likely to limit the potential harm arising from licensed premises according to the needs of the community.  Social impact statements are a requirement in many comparable international jurisdictions, such as NSW.</text>

          <text>Allowing local authorities to develop local alcohol plans that must then be given effect in licensing decisions means that deliberate thought will be given to the role that alcohol plays in the community. These plans are developed in consultation with the community, and provide an opportunity for the community to strategically consider how liquor should be sold and regulated in the community to best meet the needs of their community.  This may mean reducing the trading hours for licensed premises or restricting the areas where liquor can be sold.  Some communities have developed an <quote.in quote="1">entertainment area</quote.in> to isolate liquor sales in one area.  Aligning local alcohol plans with licensing decisions provides a tailored and coordinated response to meet the needs of the particular community in relation to the sale and supply of liquor.  </text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Costs</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>There will be industry costs arising from the preferred option, as grocery stores will be prevented from obtaining a liquor licence, unless they meet the new minimum size criteria. No compensation is payable. However, there are transitional arrangements to help minimise the financial loss of losing an off-licence and allows businesses time to prepare for the change. For example, a licence held in relation to these premises will not be cancelled during its licence term as a result of these proposals. This proposal is likely to increase costs for consumers, who may need to travel further to obtain alcohol.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Clarifying the types of sales suitable from a supermarket or liquor store may result in the loss of potential sales from these premises.  However, it will save costs associated with testing the law by applying to the District Licensing Agency or Liquor Licensing Authority to obtain a licence for these types of sales, or for enforcement agencies to challenge these types of licences.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>If a local alcohol plan requires applicants to include a social impact statement within their licensing application, which will impose additional costs on applicants for a liquor licence.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There are also potential costs arising from increased community input into licensing decisions through a broader range of criteria being considered and applicants being able to object to licences or licence conditions. Restrictions arising from these objections may reduce earnings from liquor sales and add costs for potential licensees responding to objections at hearings.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There will be costs associated with local authorities developing local alcohol plans, where they do not already exist. There may also be costs for individual licensed premises that have additional licence conditions imposed through the application of the local alcohol plan during licensing decisions.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Conclusion</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Overall, the benefits arising from the preferred option are expected to outweigh any costs. Each proposal is expected to contribute a small amount towards the reduction of liquor abuse, and is part of a package that should be considered together. The cost of alcohol related harm to society, e.g. violent offences, traffic crashes and disturbances including property damage is high. Even a small reduction means a substantial savings in social costs.</text>
