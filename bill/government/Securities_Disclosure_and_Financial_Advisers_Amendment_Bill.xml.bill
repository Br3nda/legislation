          <text>The Securities Disclosure and Financial Advisers Amendment Bill responds to the current international financial crisis by removing unnecessary impediments to capital raising, while ensuring the timely disclosure of relevant information to prospective investors.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill principally provides for the use and regulation of a simplified disclosure prospectus. This new type of prospectus will, in connection with regulations to be made under existing regulation-making powers, enable stock exchange listed issuers to offer certain debt and equity securities without the need to duplicate information that they have already publicly disclosed under their continuous disclosure obligations.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Part 1</emphasis> of the Bill amends the Securities Act 1978. It provides for simplified disclosure prospectuses to be sent to investors instead of an investment statement, for all prospectus amendments to be sent to investors before subscription, and for additional Securities Commission powers to ensure these prospectuses are used only by appropriate issuers and that potential investors will have sufficient time to consider adverse information before subscribing.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Part 1</emphasis> of the Bill also significantly improves the workability of rules for exempt persons and people deemed by the Securities Act 1978 not to be members of the public, for whom disclosure under the Act is not required.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Part 2</emphasis> of the Bill amends the Financial Advisers Act 2008, which regulates people who provide financial advice on offers of securities, to correct an error in the assent version of that Act and to make a number of other minor, tidying-up, amendments.</text>

A simplified disclosure prospectus is a registered prospectus that may be used only if the issuer is subject to a disclosure obligation and if regulations made under section 70 of the Securities Act 1978 allow for this.

However, there are some restrictions that must be met before this provision will apply to an offer. The proposed amendment is related to existing section 3(2)(a)(iia).</text>

            <text>Thirdly, it inserts a <emphasis style="italic">new subsection (2CBA)</emphasis> which mirrors subsection (2CB) but is expanded to include a person to whom an offer does not constitute an offer of securities to the public because of the application of section 3(2). This means that under section 5(2CB) an offer of securities can be made to persons who are wealthy, experienced in investing money, or experienced in the industry or business to which the securities relate (<emphasis style="bold">eligible persons</emphasis>). Under <emphasis style="italic">new subsection (2CBA)</emphasis>, a single offer can be made to eligible persons and to persons to whom an offer does not constitute an offer of securities to the public because of the application of section 3(2). Only the rules on prohibition of advertisements and criminal liability for misstatements in sections 38B and 58 will apply to either of those offers.</text>

            <text>Finally, it clarifies that, for the purposes of section 5(2CC)(a) and (2CD), person includes the trustees of a trust acting jointly in their capacity as trustees of that trust and a sole trustee of a trust acting in his, her, or its capacity as trustee of that trust. In effect, this means that an offer of securities can be made to a trust that is wealthy (as defined in section 5(2CD)) and (because of the effect of section 5(2CB)) only the rules on prohibition of advertisements and criminal liability for misstatements in sections 38B and 58 will apply to that offer.</text>

Subsection (4) provides that an allotment that is made in contravention of this section is invalid and of no effect. <emphasis style="italic">Clause 9</emphasis> inserts a <emphasis style="italic">new subsection (1A)</emphasis> which provides that no allotment of a security that is offered in a simplified disclosure prospectus may be made by a person who is subject to a prohibition order while that order is in force or in contravention of <emphasis style="italic">new section 44AD(1)</emphasis> (which concerns the effect of an extension order). If an allotment is made in contravention of this new subsection, subsection (4) will apply and the allotment will be invalid and of no effect.

              <text>Section 37A sets out a number of requirements concerning the allotment of securities. Subsection (3) provides that an allotment that is made in contravention of this section may be cancelled by the subscriber. <emphasis style="italic">Clause 11</emphasis> inserts a <emphasis style="italic">new paragraph (ab)</emphasis> in subsection (1), which provides that no allotment of a security that is offered in a simplified disclosure prospectus may be made if the subscriber did not receive, before subscribing for the security, a copy of that simplified disclosure prospectus and all registered amendments to that prospectus. Further, no allotment of a security that is offered in a simplified disclosure prospectus may be made if the subscriber subscribes for the security before the Securities Commission makes an extension order in relation to that prospectus. If an allotment is made in contravention of this subsection, subsection (3) will apply and the allotment may be cancelled. Section 59 will also apply, meaning that the contravention will also be an offence.</text>

              <text>An allotment of a security to which <emphasis style="italic">new section 37A(1)(ab)(ii)</emphasis> applies may be made if the subscriber resubscribes for that security after the date on which the extension order was made. In effect, this cancels the original subscription, meaning that it no longer may be cancelled by the subscriber under section 37A(3). This accords with the decision of Justice Henry in <emphasis style="italic">Re AIC Merchant Finance Limited (in rec); Watson &amp; Anor v National Mutual Life Nominees Limited (No 2)</emphasis> (1988) 4 NZCLC 64,403 in which the implications of section 37A were considered.</text>

If any of these circumstances apply, the Commission may make an extension order extending the date of allotment of a security that is offered in a simplified disclosure prospectus for various, specified periods of time.

          <text>The world is currently in the midst of the worst financial crisis for many decades. The most immediate and pressing financial sector issue has been the breakdown in credit markets. The preferred option is to provide for a simplified disclosure prospectus that may be used by listed issuers who are subject to continuous disclosure requirements and to amend the existing definitions for exemptions from standard disclosure requirements. These changes should remove unnecessary impediments to capital raising while still securing the timely disclosure of relevant information to prospective investors.</text>

          <text>In November 2008 the Capital Market Development Taskforce, an industry-led group of private and public sector participants established in July 2008 to produce a plan to develop New Zealand's capital market, released a report in response to the financial crisis focused primarily on increasing the availability of capital for New Zealand firms and reducing the costs of raising capital. The report contained several recommendations for urgent government action to amend some of the disclosure requirements for securities offerings in the Securities Act 1978.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The objective of the Securities Act 1978 is to facilitate capital raising by securing the timely disclosure of relevant information to prospective investors. However, there are some aspects of the disclosure regime that result in the duplication of information provided to investors. Specifically, there is duplication in the information provided to investors under continuous disclosure and in the context of a securities offering by a listed company.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The main advantage of this approach would be to provide the opportunity to consider how any proposed changes to the disclosure regime would interact with a wider set of potential changes to the Securities Act 1978. However, the need to urgently respond to the current credit crisis makes it inadvisable to wait to give effect to these proposals as part of that review.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Option 2: listed issuers may offer securities with only an investment statement </explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>For listed issuers, one option is to require only an investment statement and not a full prospectus. This is the approach used in the Securities (Local Authority Exemption) Amendment Act 2008.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The strength of this proposal is that listed issuers would only need to prepare 1 disclosure document instead of both an investment statement and a full prospectus. This option is not considered appropriate for the market more generally because local authorities are supported by their rating base and are therefore comparatively lower risk. This option would therefore not sufficiently meet the needs of potential investors in the market more generally because the protections (such as registration) and liability for misleading statements that apply to prospectuses do not apply to an investment statement, and an investment statement does not deliver the same level of assurance that all information material to the offer will be disclosed. </text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Option 3: listed issuers may use a term sheet for debt offerings </explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>For listed issuers, the Capital Market Development Taskforce proposed a term sheet as an alternative to a full prospectus and investment statement when issuing debt securities. The term sheet would contain—</text>
          <list>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>a statement from the directors of the issuer that due inquiry had been made into the information material to the issuance; and</text>
              </para>
            </item>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>directions to the firm’s continuous disclosure documentation.</text>
              </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>While this change would assist listed issuers of debt securities, benefits would increase if the reduced disclosure requirements applied to a wider range of securities offerings.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Preferred option</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option is to provide for a new prospectus that may be used by listed issuers of designated debt or equity securities who are subject to continuous disclosure requirements, and to amend the provisions for exemptions from standard disclosure requirements.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Simplified disclosure prospectus for listed issuers of designated debt and equity offerings</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The simplified disclosure prospectus would rely on the information released through the continuous disclosure obligations of listed issuers, reducing duplication between continuous disclosure and disclosure for a securities offering. The simplified disclosure prospectus should also include any additional information material to the offering.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>As a result, listed issuers could produce 1 disclosure document for a securities offering (instead of producing both a full prospectus and an investment statement) and could reference any relevant material already released under continuous disclosure (instead of reproducing material that is already available to the public). The obvious advantage for listed issuers would be the reduction in time and pecuniary costs of complying with the full disclosure regime, making it easier for listed issuers to seek to raise capital. Listed firms would only have the option of using the simplified disclosure prospectus to issue securities of equal or higher rank than those securities already issued by the firm.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is possible that investors might perceive the regime as requiring the disclosure of less information, insufficient for them to invest in the securities offered under a simplified disclosure prospectus. However, the simplified disclosure prospectus would not reduce the amount of information provided to investors; it would simply reduce duplication between forms of disclosure.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Any relevant announcements made through continuous disclosure will need to be referenced in the simplified disclosure prospectus and freely available to investors, eg, the issuer’s Internet site. Liability, penalties, and remedies for the disclosure of false or misleading information will apply to a simplified disclosure prospectus as they do to a full prospectus. </text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Amend categories of exemption from the full disclosure requirements </explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The preferred option for exemptions is to amend the existing definitions for exemptions from standard disclosure requirements in order to—</text>
          <list>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>allow a single offer of securities to both categories of person who are exempt from disclosure requirements without requiring the issuer to prepare a full prospectus. This corrects an anomaly where issuers are presently only able to take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements for an offer to 1 category of exempt person, not both categories together; and</text>
              </para>
            </item>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>allow incremental offers to be made by those who have invested $500,000 in the past 12 months without requiring the issuer to prepare a full prospectus. At present, the exemption from full disclosure only applies to an initial offering to those who are required to pay a minimum of $500,000, and full disclosure requirements apply for any incremental offers; and</text>
              </para>
            </item>
            <item>

              <para>
                <text>clarify that a family trust is a person for the purpose of applying the eligible person criteria (and so eligible for disclosure exemptions). Although this is already the stated interpretation of the Securities Commission, some market participants are wary and seek certainty by way of an explicit amendment to the Securities Act 1978; and</text>
              </para>
            </item>
            <item>
              <label auto.number="no" denominator="yes"/>
              <para>
                <text>allow certification that a person is wealthy (and so eligible for disclosure exemptions) every 12 rather than 6 months. This change will make it less onerous for a wealthy person to qualify for an exemption from full disclosure requirements.</text>
              </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The changes apply to both listed and unlisted companies and will particularly benefit private companies who tend to approach investors for capital directly, often in cases where an exemption applies, eg, where the investor is well known to the issuer. Investors will not be disadvantaged by these amendments since the exemptions from disclosure requirements only apply to investors who are assumed to already possess the information necessary to make an assessment of the offer, or who are capable of obtaining the necessary information, or who have sufficient experience in the market not to need the standard level of disclosure, eg, sophisticated or habitual investors or investors who have an existing relationship with the issuer.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Implementation and review</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The detail and content of the simplified disclosure prospectus will be contained in regulations to be promulgated under the regulation-making authority of section 70 of the Securities Act 1978. However, the Securities Disclosure and Financial Advisers Amendment Bill contains amendments to the Securities Act 1978 that are necessary to enable the use of a simplified disclosure prospectus, eg, an exemption from the requirement to provide an investment statement for every securities offering. The regulations and Bill will need to commence simultaneously to give effect to the policy.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The amended categories of exemption from full disclosure requirements can only be implemented through an amendment to the Securities Act 1978, and the Securities Disclosure and Financial Advisers Amendment Bill is the preferred vehicle for change.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Securities Commission will assume additional powers in order to monitor and enforce compliance with the new requirements. These powers are consistent with the Commission’s current role and functions, and their existing responsibilities in relation to the Securities Act 1978.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Officials will review the Securities Disclosure and Financial Advisers Amendment Bill as a part of the wider review of the Securities Act 1978.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Consultation</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>As part of the 2006 consultation on the Review of Financial Products and Providers, MED sought submissions on whether issuers who are subject to a continuous disclosure regime and who want to issue new securities of a class already listed should be able to use a transaction-specific document. The vast majority of respondents were in favour of such a proposal.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Capital Market Development Taskforce provided a catalyst for government action to reduce disclosure requirements for listed issuers and amend the exemptions from disclosure requirements under the Securities Act 1978. The Taskforce is an industry-led group that includes numerous representatives of the finance industry. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Due to the urgency attached to this reform, MED consulted with a targeted group of industry experts in order to agree technical details to give proper effect to the policy. MED has worked closely with the Securities Commission in the development of this policy. Treasury was also consulted during policy development, on the draft Cabinet paper, and on the regulatory impact statement. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was informed of these policy proposals. The Reserve Bank was consulted on the draft Cabinet paper. Officials also met with the Legislation Design Committee for technical review prior to finalising the drafting instructions for the proposed amendments to the Securities Act 1978, and will continue to work with them in the design of the regulations. Officials have also notified Australian authorities of these proposals in the context of the Agreement Between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand in relation to Mutual Recognition of Securities Offerings.</text>
