        <explnote.subhead1>Background: the need for reform</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>This Bill is an initial response to the Government’s concerns about how our society should respond to the financial and emotional costs that fall on victims of crime, particularly victims of serious crimes such as murder, sexual violation, and grievous assault. Underpinning the Government’s concern is that failing to recognise and acknowledge the interests of victims in the justice process, or failing to address the negative impact of crime on victims, risks eroding victims’ confidence in the justice sector’s ability to deal effectively with crime.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>An important element of our democratic society is that people have confidence in the rule of law being maintained and in the ability of the justice sector to respond appropriately to breaches of the law. Such confidence is necessary not only if an individual is accused of a crime but also if an individual is the victim of crime. Failing to recognise or to minimise the harm to victims may cause victims to become disillusioned or fearful, or to withdraw their co-operation with the formal justice system.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that offenders contribute to addressing the harm they cause to victims. This Bill proposes imposing a levy of $50 on offenders at the point of sentencing. The imposition of the levy is a first and early step assisting the Government to improve the criminal justice sector response to victims of crime. Priority will be accorded to victims of serious offences.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Main changes to existing law</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill amends the Sentencing Act 2002.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill provides that all offenders who have been convicted of an offence must pay an offender levy of $50. The amount of the levy may be changed by regulation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The levy is in addition to any other penalty that the criminal courts may impose, such as imprisonment, community service, a fine, or reparation to be paid to any victim. The courts are not to consider whether or not the levy will cause hardship, which is a consideration associated with a sentence involving reparation, or to consider the levy when taking into account the financial capacity of the offender in determining the amount of a fine.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>If the court imposes on an offender a sentence of reparation or a fine, or both, the payments received from the offender will be used first to pay the reparation owed, then the offender levy and then the fine.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The offender will pay the levy to the Secretary for Justice who will pay the money into a specific Crown bank account known as the victims' services bank account. The amount of the levy may be amended by way of regulation. The operation requirements of the victims’ services bank account will be prescribed by regulation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Finally, the Bill requires the Secretary for Justice to approve an organisation as an approved agency for providing victims with services that are paid for from the victims’ services bank account. Criteria for approval are outlined in the Bill.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Victims of crime often face significant costs associated with the crimes committed against them that are not covered by ACC, other state help, or by court ordered reparation. Imposing a $50 levy on all convicted offenders at the point of sentencing will ensure offenders contribute to addressing the harm their offending has caused, and will generate a revenue stream that will fund the provision of additional services for victims of crime.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The impacts of serious crime on individual victims can include physical, emotional, and mental injuries and property loss. There are also consequential costs associated with addressing these impacts for victims and society. In addition, victims can be further victimised by the criminal justice system process if they are not adequately supported through it. The impacts for society of not providing adequate services and support for victims can include a loss of confidence in the criminal justice system and a potential loss of productivity where victims’ recovery is delayed.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>While convicted offenders are held accountable for their offending through the sentencing process and may be required to pay reparation in individual cases, imposing a $50 levy on all convicted offenders will also ensure they contribute to meeting the general costs associated with their offending for victims and society. </text>

        <para>
          <text>There are no non-regulatory options that will enable a levy to be imposed. Imposing a levy on convicted offenders that is automatically applied at each sentencing event requires legislative change for it to be mandated and enforced by the courts. The fundamental constitutional principle which applies to the imposition of government charges is that only Parliament can levy money for the Crown. Legislative authority for the imposition of fees is usually provided by including empowering provisions in an Act to authorise the making of regulations to fix fees or charges.<footnote id="DLM1826705"><para><text>LAC Guidelines 3.4.1.</text></para></footnote></text>

        <para>
          <text>Although the levy is not a sentence, establishing the levy under the Sentencing Act 2002 is consistent with Government policy to impose the levy on convicted offenders at the point of sentencing. The alternative option would be to include empowering provisions in the Victims’ Rights Act 2002 (<emphasis style="bold">VRA</emphasis>). However, the current focus of the VRA is on victims' rights and principles for the treatment of victims by state agencies and is not on offenders' obligations towards victims.</text>

          <text>Through this policy convicted offenders will be made to contribute to addressing the harm that their criminal behaviour has caused victims. The proposed reforms will also generate a revenue stream that will fund the provision of services to victims of crime and will also improve justice sector outcomes for victims. Victims of crime often face significant costs to assist their participation in the justice process or to help them recover from injuries not covered by ACC or other state help. Reparation when awarded may also not sufficiently cover the costs victims face as a result of the crime.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Victims, already traumatised by the crime itself, can also be further impacted by the criminal justice system process contributing to further distress and harm unless they receive sufficient support throughout the process. This is particularly important for those people who have been victims of serious crime. This policy will provide revenue that can be used to target gaps in services for victims of crime and better meet their support needs. Supporting victims can enhance their trust in the justice system, and contribute to reduced revictimisation.</text>

It is anticipated that over time the revenue generated from the levy will cover ongoing collections costs and will rise to sufficient levels to fund services for victims of crime.</text>
