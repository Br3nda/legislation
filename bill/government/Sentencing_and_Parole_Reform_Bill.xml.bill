        <para>
          <text>The purpose of the Bill is to create a three stage regime of increasing consequences for the worst repeat violent offenders.  The Bill is specifically targeted at offenders who show contempt for the court system and the safety of others by continuing to offend despite long prison sentences and judicial warnings.  </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This regime is intended to improve public safety by incapacitating these offenders for longer periods.  It is also intended to increase the confidence of victims and the public in the justice system through truth in sentencing (no parole for certain offenders) and longer sentences (stage 3 of the regime). </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>An offender qualifies for each stage if he or she receives a determinate sentence of imprisonment of five years or more, life imprisonment or preventive detention (a <def-term id="DLM1845302">qualifying sentence</def-term>) for a specified serious violent offence. The three stages are as follows:</text>

The court must impose a minimum non-parole period of 25 years on the life sentence unless satisfied that it would be manifestly unjust to do so (in which case it must impose a lesser non-parole period).</text>

        <para>
          <text>The Bill also provides the courts with the option of sentencing an offender to life without parole in the worst cases of murder.

          <text>An offender serving a life sentence without parole will only be eligible for release on compassionate grounds.

        <para>
          <text>There is a concern that serious and violent offenders go on to commit further serious and violent crimes. The policies outlined below are intended to target the worst repeat violent offenders, that is, those offenders who commit a series of serious violent offences (qualifying offences). Offenders who commit a first qualifying offence will be warned of the consequences of subsequent serious offending. If offenders commit second and then third qualifying offences, the consequences become increasingly severe, to reflect public concern about this type of repeat offending. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Offenders whose second qualifying offence is murder will receive a sentence of life without parole. The courts will also have the option of imposing life without parole in the worst cases of murder.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The policies are intended to enhance public confidence in the criminal justice system. Victims and their families will also benefit through increased certainty around prison terms and parole (where parole is available at all).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The impact of the policies on the prison population is estimated to be gradual but increasing over time as a relatively small number of offenders are likely to receive long sentences. The costs of the policies will gradually increase over time, as elderly offenders are significantly more costly to detain than the average prisoner. The policies are expected to impact on Māori the most. The policies also have some risks for public confidence in the criminal justice system due to the potential for disproportionate outcomes. </text>

          <text>The policy does not achieve the objectives of truth-in-sentencing/ certainty around release dates. The policy does not spare victims and their families multiple parole hearings. The policy is also less likely to encourage offenders to appreciate the consequences of repeat offending, as offenders will not as readily be able to anticipate when a preventive detention sentence will be imposed. The benefit of the policy is that it is less likely to lead to changes in sentencing practice by judges seeking to avoid the disproportionately harsh effects of a qualifying offence as compared with one that receives a sentence of just less than 5 years. </text>

There is a possibility that removing the worst repeat violent offenders from the community for longer periods of time will result in less serious violent offending in the community. However, offenders who commit serious violent offences do not necessarily have previous sentences for serious violent offences.<footnote id="DLM1845309"><para><text>Department of Corrections.</text></para></footnote></text>

        <para>
          <text>Public confidence in the criminal justice system: the worst repeat offenders policy raises the potential for disproportionate outcomes, which may negatively affect public confidence in the criminal justice system and lead to increased costs, particularly in the form of appeals. An offender who commits a third qualifying offence that would otherwise be liable for around 5 years' imprisonment could receive 4 years 11 months' imprisonment, or a mandatory life sentence with a lengthy non-parole period (25 years unless that would be manifestly unjust). These offenders will have high incentives to: take special measures to avoid conviction; plead not guilty; and exhaust all avenues of appeal.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The policies have the considerable potential to affect the confidence of Māori in the criminal justice system, as they will impact on Māori the most. Māori are more likely than other ethnic groupings to be convicted of violent offences. The 2007 sentencing and conviction statistics show that 5 680 Māori were convicted and sentenced of violent offences, as compared with 4 630 Europeans, meaning Māori are more than three-times over-represented on a population basis in this category of offences.<footnote id="DLM1845310"><para><text>The trend is the same for serious violent offences (2696 Māori as compared with 2040 Europeans, but the definition used in the statistics of “serious violent” will not necessarily match the definition in the Bill). </text></para></footnote> Long sentences without parole deprive offenders of the possibility of rehabilitation, compounding the effects on the whānau of offenders and the intergenerational effects on children separated from parents. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Offenders understanding the consequences: the research literature on criminal deterrence indicates a mixed picture, although most research has found that imprisonment has little if any specific deterrent effect.<footnote id="DLM1845311"><para><text>The Effect of Prison on Crime –research paper for the Effective Interventions Project, Ministry of Justice.</text></para></footnote> There is a great deal of evidence indicating that offending rates decrease only marginally as a result of penalties being increased.<footnote id="DLM1845312"><para><text>Department of Corrections.</text></para></footnote> A study on the wide-sweeping Californian three-strike laws did find a statistically significant deterrent effect,<footnote id="DLM1845313"><para><text><emphasis style="italic">Does Three Strikes Deter? A Non-Parametric Estimation</emphasis>, Eric Helland and Alexander Tabarrok.</text></para></footnote> but the high cost of that deterrent effect needs to be weighed against the finding that almost all crime was committed by offenders who had not received strikes. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>If it is accepted that offenders do weigh the costs of offending, the worst repeat offender policy will create perverse incentives on offenders who have become liable for life sentences. These offenders face an identical penalty for all serious offending except murder.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Costs</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>Both the life without parole and the worst repeat violent offender policies represent a small but gradually increasing transfer of costs within the funding available to the justice sector from the detection and prevention of offending to the detention of offenders who may, particularly once they are elderly, pose no risk to the public.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The major direct financial implications of the worst repeat violent offender policy follow from an increase in the prison population. This impact will not be felt for at least 10 years, when a total of 25 additional prison beds will be needed to accommodate prisoners sentenced under the policy. This number increases to 46 after 15 years and to 70 after 20 years. It is estimated that when the full effects of implementation have been felt after 50 years, an additional 132 prison beds will have been needed.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The largest component of the increase over the longer term will be offenders who have previously received a sentence of 5 years or more who are sentenced to life imprisonment without parole following conviction for murder. This accounts for about 70 of the additional 132 prison beds. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There is a risk that punitive measures such as these policies will increase the level of punitiveness in the criminal justice system generally, which will increase costs across all parts of the criminal justice sector. </text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Stock of regulation</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The policies amend existing legislation, but do not increase the stock of regulation. The policies will be in addition to the current rules around sentencing and parole. However, they do not make any existing rules redundant or require that they be removed or altered. </text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Implementation and review</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The policies will be given effect through legislation. The policies will be monitored and evaluated by the Department of Corrections and Ministry of Justice. As detailed above, the major impact is expected to be on the prison population but the policies are not expected to have any impact for at least 10 years.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Consultation</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>These policies were canvassed among relevant government agencies. The scope of the violent offences covered by the worst repeat violent offenders’ policy was revised following comments by Corrections, Police, and Women’s Affairs. Significant concerns have been raised by agencies about the possibility for disproportionate impacts as between offenders and between ethnic groups, but the policy has not been revised. </text>
