        <explnote.subhead1>Changed environment for serious fraud investigations</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Serious Fraud Office (<def-term id="DLM1242202">SFO</def-term>) was created in 1990 following the 1987 share market crash and widespread public concern about corporate misconduct. It was modelled on the United Kingdom SFO, with the intention that this small, specialist multi-disciplinary agency would fill a gap between existing law enforcement and regulatory agencies. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Since 1990, the nature and scale of fraud offending has changed. Fraud is now made more complex by the impact of globalisation, computers, Internet access, and identity fraud, which provide for levels of anonymity and speed well beyond those of the 1990s.  While there does still exist a category of such fraud that is strictly the criminal abuse of commercial practice and is not covered by the taint of organised crime in the sense that it is generally perceived, there is a clear track of convergence between organised crime interests and the commercial world.  The more serious organised criminal enterprises are using commercial and financial expertise not just as devices to launder the proceeds of crime or to accrue assets, but also to utilise financial processes and decision makers within the system for criminal financial gain.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There are now 5 agencies that can address aspects of corporate fraud or white collar crime: the Inland Revenue Department, police, SFO, Securities Commission, and National Enforcement Unit (<def-term id="DLM1242203">NEU</def-term>) of the Ministry of Economic Development. In addition, reforms continue within the Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Justice, Reserve Bank of New Zealand and Treasury regarding financial products, providers, and anti-money laundering regulation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Against that background, police have also further developed their capability to investigate and prosecute serious or complex fraud. The police now deal with fraud with a significant dedicated resource, including forensic accountants and detectives working in dedicated fraud squads such as the Company Fraud and General Fraud squads in the Auckland City District. The police employ document examiners, computer forensic staff, legal advisors, and forensic accountants.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Integration of SFO into new Organised and Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The development of a new Organised and Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand (<def-term id="DLM1242204">OFCANZ</def-term>) represents a significant opportunity for those presently engaged in the investigation of serious and complex fraud.  It also offers a new mechanism to increase the attention given to serious and complex fraud while significantly challenging those engaged in organised crime, whether of an international or domestic nature.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Accordingly, this Bill disestablishes the current SFO so that its existing functions and powers can be reformed into a permanent Serious Fraud Taskforce within OFCANZ. This decision provides an effective response to the changed environment and establishes a more streamlined response to both fraud and organised crime. Combining the skills, abilities, tools, and resources of the 2 organisations to undertake the financial investigations required to more effectively combat organised crime and serious or complex fraud is a significant step forward.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This integration also allows the greatest degree of flexibility and coordination in the investigation of serious or complex fraud, while ensuring that the investigation of serious or complex fraud is identified as an ongoing priority within the police. OFCANZ's ability to combat serious or complex fraud will be substantially enhanced by the integration of the SFO.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Transitional serious or complex fraud investigatory powers</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The nature of crime is trending towards complex Internet transactions and document-based crime.  This change indicates that document production and limited compulsory examination powers should be added to the toolbox of police investigatory powers for the investigation of a range of crime types, including serious and corporate fraud and organised crime.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>As part of the Government’s wider reform of all law enforcement search and surveillance powers, the Government’s Search and Surveillance Bill will therefore propose that document production and limited compulsory examination orders be established as part of the investigatory toolbox available to all criminal investigations.  These 2 powers have proven particularly useful when unravelling complex financial transactions and business structures that have been used for criminal purposes.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Accordingly, in order to ensure that OFCANZ retains the powers necessary to investigate serious and complex fraud in the period leading up to the final enactment of the wider search and surveillance regime, transitional document production and limited examination powers are provided for in this Bill.  These powers retain the current commercial fraud investigative capability, while also providing additional safeguards such as prior judicial approval and a better definition of those who may be subject to a compulsory examination.  As these transitional powers reflect the wider reforms contained in the Government’s Search and Surveillance Bill, there will be some temporary inconsistencies with the current law as it applies to other older search and surveillance powers.  However, these inconsistencies will not hamper the ability of OFCANZ to perform its functions and it is intended that these proposed transitional powers will expire upon Order in Council once the Government’s Search and Surveillance Bill is enacted and comes into force.</text>
