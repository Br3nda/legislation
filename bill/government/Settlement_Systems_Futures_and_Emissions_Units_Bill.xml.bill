          <text>Part 5C of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989 currently provides for the Reserve Bank to designate a settlement system that settles payments. It is also currently possible to designate a settlement system that settles products, but the designation may only provide protection of irrevocability to the settlement of the payment component of a transaction and not to the settlement of the property component of the transaction. Therefore, if the payment was made in consideration for a transfer of title to property such as securities, the transfer of title may not be protected.</text>

          <text>Designation lends statutory backing to the settlement of transactions.

          <text>NZX maintains that technical amendments are required to New Zealand’s legislation in order to trade emissions units and emissions units futures products on an exchange in New Zealand, and to clear and settle those transactions adequately. Exchange trading is a useful step in the development of any new market.

        <para>
          <text>NZX would prefer the requested legislative amendments to be in force before their settlement system becomes operational, or alternatively at least have the necessary legislative amendments progressing through parliament. NZX’s upgraded settlement system is still under development. In a recent meeting with Ministers, NZX’s CEO said that the new system may not be operational until April 2009. However, NZX has indicated publicly that it will be ready in October 2008. Although NZX currently operates a settlement system without designation, NZX advises that they will not be able to operate a central counter party without designation because they will have difficulty accessing the necessary synthetic capital required to support this model of settlement. Any delay will cost NZX lost revenue from their expanded services and upgraded services.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Restricting the technical amendments to emissions units traded in regulated emissions trading schemes would simplify the amendments since regulated emissions units are well defined in existing legislation. There are many challenges inherent in any attempt to adequately define voluntary emissions units because the market is still developing and consistent standards and practices have not yet evolved. However, excluding voluntary emissions units from the technical amendments would be inconsistent with the policy objective and the Government’s regard for the voluntary carbon market.</text>

        <para>
          <text>To provide a signal that trades in securities and other products can be cleared and settled in New Zealand through systems that meet the expectations of international and domestic participants, the preferred option is to extend the current payments system designation regime under Part 5C of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989 to settlement systems, make the Securities Commission a joint regulator with the Reserve Bank, and make explicit reference to relevant international standards as a matter that the joint regulators may have regard to when designating systems.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>NZX and the Reserve Bank are both expected to seek designation for their settlement systems under the new law. The cost of complying with the new regulatory regime is optional for settlement system operators. Although NZX has been the catalyst for these amendments to Part 5C of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989, the preferred option is to design an opt-in designation regime for settlement systems that is available to any provider of settlement services in New Zealand who applies for designation and meets the relevant criteria, and is thus of general benefit to the development of the New Zealand financial market. In parallel, the Government will undertake a general review of New Zealand’s settlement and clearing infrastructure in response to concerns raised during consultation.</text>

          <text>The preferred option for futures exchanges is to reduce compliance costs by amending the Securities Markets Act 1988 to align the regulation of exchanges wanting to operate in both futures and securities markets and codifying that participants approved by the operator of an authorised futures exchange are authorised futures dealers.

          <text>While it is already possible to trade emissions units through over the counter transactions and other means, registered exchange trading of emissions units and emissions units futures products would provide an additional trading option for those in the market.

          <text>The Settlement Systems, Futures, and Emissions Units Bill gives effect to the policy objective for settlement systems through an extension of the existing regime for the regulation of designated payment systems in New Zealand under Part 5C of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989. The Bill provides settlement systems operating in New Zealand with the option of applying for designation and being regulated to relevant international standards by the Reserve Bank and the Securities Commission. In return, a designated settlement system receives additional legal protections to support the integrity of the system in the case of a participant’s default, including through an amendment to the Personal Property Securities Act 1999. Once the amendments take effect, the operators of any settlement systems seeking designation will still need to apply for approval from the joint regulators.</text>

          <text>The Settlement Systems, Futures, and Emissions Units Bill gives effect to the stated policy objective for futures exchanges by amending the Securities Markets Act 1988 so that an exchange registered under Part 2B of that Act may be registered either with respect to securities markets only or with respect to both securities markets and futures markets. The Settlement Systems, Futures, and Emissions Units Bill also provides that market participants who have been approved by an authorised futures exchange under its operating rules shall be deemed to be authorised to deal in futures contracts under section 38 of the Securities Markets Act 1988.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Following initial policy engagement with NZX in 2007, the Government undertook targeted consultation with a wider group of stakeholders in the preparation of a discussion document, which was released in February 2008 with an exposure draft of the proposed legislative amendments. The Ministry of Economic Development received 19 submissions on the draft Emissions Units, Settlement Systems, and Futures Bill (the <def-term id="DLM1474010">draft Bill</def-term>). Significant submissions on the draft Bill are summarised as follows:</text>

              <para>
                <text>submitters were critical of the consultation and policy development process, requesting more time to make comments, wider consultation, workshops, and additional consultation  documents. A significant proportion of submitters expressed concern that legislation had been drafted solely to further NZX’s commercial interests. The Government has since individually met with a number of submitters to hear their concerns and will conduct further consultation as part of a New Zealand approach to clearing and settlement:</text>

              <para>
                <text>submitters were concerned that the implications for New Zealand’s financial market infrastructure should be further examined given the public utility nature of clearing and settlement systems, and the network effects that could result from a private, vertically integrated monopoly provider. These implications will be examined as part of a New Zealand approach to clearing and settlement:</text>

              <para>
                <text>submitters suggested that the Government should amend the proposed joint regulator model, and provide a process for managing potential conflicts of interest within the Reserve Bank. Officials are confident that the joint regulator model is the best model for recognising both the Reserve Bank's and the Securities Commission’s interests in the regulation of settlement systems. The joint regulators are preparing a memorandum of understanding to govern their roles. Institutional arrangements are in place to ensure a high degree of independence between the Reserve Bank’s operations and policy functions. The joint regulator model also addresses potential conflicts of interest relating to the Reserve Bank being the operator of Austraclear NZ:</text>

                <text>submitters were critical of the requirement to seek the regulators' approval for every critical rule change that is material to the designation order. This process has been amended to assume that any rule change is valid unless disallowed by the regulators:</text>

              <para>
                <text>one submitter requested that the regulation of designated payment systems be delineated from designated settlement systems. The proposed legislation has been amended to reflect that the Securities Commission has a limited interest in systems that solely settle payments, in recognition of the status quo for payment systems under Part 5C of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989:</text>

              <para>
                <text>submitters suggested that the approval criteria for a designated settlement system should explicitly include adequacy of financial resources and adequacy of the system’s arrangements in a default by the central clearing party. These criteria are implicit in the more general criteria outlined in the Bill:</text>

                <text>submitters suggested that improvements could be made to provisions  on collateral, priority, and the Personal Property Securities Act 1999. Where possible, these provisions have been refined, but general submissions on the Personal Property Securities  Act 1999 are outside the scope of this policy process and cannot be addressed in the Bill:</text>

              <para>
                <text>submitters were concerned that the proposed amendment relating to the authorisation of futures dealers removed the ability of the Securities Commission to authorise futures dealers independently. This is not the case; the Bill simply codifies the status quo in legislation:</text>
              </para>

            <item>

              <para>
                <text>submitters were confused by the bundling of emissions trading issues with generic financial market reform and felt this was a barrier to understanding the legislative amendments. Officials have therefore been careful to delineate the discrete policy issues for emissions units and settlement systems in their advice. Officials also see merit in separating the technical amendments relating to emissions units into a stand-alone bill, although not at the expense of the increased administration required to introduce and process two separate bills:</text>

              <para>
                <text>submitters suggested that the Government should either regulate the quality of voluntary emissions units registers, which were recognised by the draft Bill, or that it should restrict the draft Bill to the compliance market. Excluding voluntary emissions units from the technical amendments would be inconsistent with the policy objective and the Government’s regard for the voluntary carbon market. As such, the technical amendments have not been restricted to the compliance market. However, the technical amendment providing that entry on an emissions units register is prima facie evidence to title has been removed, removing the need to define which registers (and which voluntary emissions units) are regulated by the Settlement Systems, Futures, and Emissions Units Bill:</text>

              <para>
                <text>submitters were critical of the fact that the Government is willing to clarify how futures regulations apply to emissions units, but not other products, and submitted that the technical amendments failed to adequately clarify the difference between futures and physical forward contracts. Officials are satisfied that the technical amendments do not confuse futures and physical forward contracts. The futures regime for other products falls outside the scope of the policy objective for these technical amendments:</text>

              <para>
                <text>1 submitter requested that the definition of emissions units be extended to include other environmental products such as wetlands credits. This issue is expected to be raised at Select Committee. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry also asked whether there was potential to address other forms of environmental offsets. For example, in Lake Taupo there is a proposal for trading in nitrogen offsets. This falls outside the scope of the current policy objective.</text>
