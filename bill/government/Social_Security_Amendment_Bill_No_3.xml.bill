        <para>
          <text>The Bill amends the Social Security Act 1964 so that the requirement for weekly compensation payments paid under the Accident Compensation Act 2001 to be deducted dollar-for-dollar from benefit payments applies equally to weekly compensation paid by the Accident Compensation Corporation (the <emphasis style="bold">Corporation</emphasis>), an accredited employer, or a person acting on behalf of the Corporation or accredited employer.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill will provide for this amendment to apply retrospectively in order to validate the past and current practice of deducting weekly compensation payments (whether made by or on behalf of the Corporation or another person, such as an accredited employer) dollar-for-dollar from benefit payments.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The position of a person who challenged the practice of deducting weekly compensation from a benefit when that compensation was paid by an accredited employer, rather than the Corporation, is protected by the provision that the Bill does not apply to appeals or proceedings lodged or decided before 15 April 2009.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill also amends the provision in the Social Security Act 1964 allowing backdating of an application for a benefit when payments have been made by the Corporation and the applicant's claim for weekly compensation subsequently fails. The amendment will allow this provision to apply when payments have been made on behalf of the Corporation or by or on behalf of an accredited employer.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill also amends the Social Security Act 1964 to clarify the provisions that exclude students who are eligible for assistance under the Student Allowances Regulations 1998 from receiving the accommodation supplement. The amendment makes it clear that students are not eligible for the accommodation supplement if they could receive assistance under the Student Allowances Regulations 1998 but choose not to apply for it, or if they could receive this assistance but for their own income or the income of their parents, spouse, or partner.</text>

That amendment is made in response to a decision of the Social Security Appeal Authority that, before the amendment, the effect of the definition of weekly compensation in section 71A was that payments of weekly compensation by accredited employers were not within the meaning of weekly compensation as defined in that section. The amendment also updates references to the relevant Accident Compensation legislation.</text>

The amendments extend the discretion to the situation where weekly compensation was paid on behalf of the Accident Compensation Corporation or by or on behalf of an accredited employer, and update references to the relevant Accident Compensation legislation.</text>
