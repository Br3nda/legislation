        <para>
          <text>Although there are no provisions in the current law that specifically refer to “marking graffiti” as an offence, acts of this kind are covered by sections 11 (wilful damage) and 33 (bill sticking and defacing) of the Summary Offences Act 1981, and section 269(2)(a) (intentional damage) of the Crimes Act 1961. As a response to the belief that the current legislation is ineffective in preventing graffiti the Manukau City Council (Control of Graffiti) Bill, a local Bill developed in response to the growing graffiti problem in Manukau, was introduced.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is acknowledged that graffiti vandalism is a nation-wide problem and as such the Government believes that a national strategy is required to tackle this issue, and as such, a local Bill would not address this.

          <text>The first option is to maintain the status quo, in that, graffiti vandalism would be covered by sections 11 and 33 of the Summary Offences Act and section 269 of the Crimes Act. The sale of spraycans would remain open to people of all ages. The status quo is not preferred because, while it makes graffiti an offence, the legislation is seen as out of date and ineffective for preventing graffiti. In addition, an option of a community sentence is not available for offences under section 33 of the Summary Offences Act.</text>

          <text>The STOP strategy proposes amendments to national legislation including: the establishment of a specific graffiti vandalism and tagging offence in the Summary Offences Act, with increased sentences (from the current $200 fine to a $2000 fine or a community-based sentence, or both). The new sentence option will allow offenders to take part in graffiti cleaning work groups as part of their punishment.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In addition, the proposed amendments will restrict the sale of spray paints to minors below the ages of 18 and will require retailers to display spraycans where they remain in the control of the shop keeper, thus limiting unauthorised access and theft. A fine of up to $1,500 will be imposed for the sale of spraycans to a minor and failing to securely store spraycans.</text>

          <text>The benefit of a specific offence for graffiti and a national standard for the restriction of sale to persons under 18 year of age will be to address the availability of the current primary implement for graffiti vandalism and to reduce the numbers of young persons entering the graffiti culture. Graffiti vandalism currently costs local government bodies, such as Manukau City Council, in excess of 1 million dollars per year per region.</text>
