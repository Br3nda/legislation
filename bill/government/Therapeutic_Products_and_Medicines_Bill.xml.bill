        <para>
          <text>The Therapeutic Products and Medicines Bill is an omnibus Bill. It is proposed that it be divided at the conclusion of the committee of the whole House stage of the legislative process into 2 Bills. <emphasis style="italic">Parts 1 to 5</emphasis> will then be enacted as the Therapeutic Products Act 2006, and <emphasis style="italic">Parts 6 and 7</emphasis> will become the Medicines Act 2006. This approach is proposed due to the extent of the impact on the Medicines Act 1981 of the changes effected by <emphasis style="italic">Parts 1 to 5</emphasis>.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Parts 1 to 5</emphasis> establish a new joint trans-Tasman regulatory scheme for the regulation of therapeutic products. The joint regulatory scheme will cover: the regulation of the manufacture, supply, import, export, and promotion of therapeutic products; the setting of standards in relation to the quality, safety, and efficacy or performance of therapeutic products; post-market monitoring of therapeutic products; and enforcement of the joint scheme's  requirements. Responsibility for regulating aspects of therapeutic products covered by the joint scheme will be transferred from the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority (<def-term id="DLM1046417">Medsafe</def-term>), which is part of the Ministry of Health, to the Australia New Zealand Therapeutic Products Authority (the <def-term id="DLM1046418">Authority</def-term>). The Authority's  role and governance is defined in the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand for the Establishment of a Joint Scheme for the Regulation of Therapeutic Products (the <def-term id="DLM1046419">Agreement</def-term>), signed in December 2003. It will be established by an Australian Act that will be the equivalent to <emphasis style="italic">Parts 1 to 5</emphasis>.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Government's objectives</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Government is committed to safeguarding the public health and safety of New Zealanders by establishing a new regulatory scheme for therapeutic products. To achieve this goal, the Government is proposing to set up the Authority as a world-class joint regulatory agency (the Australia New Zealand Therapeutic Products Authority) to administer a joint regulatory scheme with Australia.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The joint scheme and the Authority are being established under the Agreement. The Agreement sets out the governance and accountability arrangements for the Authority and how it is to be established. It also provides a framework for the joint regulatory scheme for therapeutic products. <emphasis style="italic">Parts 1 to 5</emphasis> give effect to the joint scheme anticipated by the Agreement. The scheme cannot commence until all Parts of the Bill are passed by Parliament. The Agreement will, similarly, come into effect only once it has been ratified by an exchange of diplomatic notes between New Zealand and Australia. This ratification will not occur until after the Bill is passed.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Key concerns to be addressed by the joint scheme</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>New Zealand is facing 2 key problems with its arrangements for regulating therapeutic products: outdated legislation, and a regulatory capacity that is not sustainable even in the short to medium term.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Addressing outdated legislation and providing a sustainable future-proofed regulatory regime</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The joint scheme will provide a means of maintaining an effective and sustainable regulatory capacity for New Zealand and Australia into the future. While New Zealand faces a capacity problem now, Australia expects to face a similar challenge to its regulatory capacity in the longer term. The Authority will provide for enhanced capacity in terms of technical expertise to evaluate the risks and benefits of increasingly complex therapeutic products. Neither New Zealand nor Australia alone has the capacity to operate a world-class regulatory scheme for therapeutic products on an ongoing basis; together, the 2 nations can pool resources and ensure that citizens of both countries gain the maximum protection in the area of therapeutic products safety.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>New Zealand's  current regulatory framework for therapeutic products, under the Medicines Act 1981 and the Medicines Regulations 1984, is outdated and gives rise to some significant safety risks, trade barriers, and costs to Crown and industry. Updating the legislation is necessary to ensure that New Zealand meets international best practice for the regulation of therapeutic products.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Ensuring the safety of medical devices and complementary medicines</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Regulation of medical devices and complementary medicines in New Zealand is minimal. The joint scheme will regulate all therapeutic products, consistent with international best practice. This includes the risk-based regulation of medical devices and complementary medicines. The scheme will enhance public confidence by subjecting medical devices, and complementary medicines to a regulatory scheme that provides assurance about safety and quality.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The joint scheme will apply the internationally harmonised approach to the regulation of medical devices developed by the Global Harmonization Taskforce partnership of the EU, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia. For New Zealand, this will mean introducing pre-market approvals, quality requirements, and an enhanced level of post-market monitoring and surveillance.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Complementary medicines include herbal remedies and medicines, traditional treatments, homeopathic remedies, and most dietary supplements. The joint scheme will, for the first time in New Zealand, introduce risk-based regulation of complementary medicines as a subset of therapeutic products. It will use an approach that enables product sponsors to gain marked authorisation by self-certification against the Scheme requirements.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Enhancing closer economic relations and facilitating trade</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The new scheme will be a significant enhancement of closer economic relations (<emphasis style="bold">CER</emphasis>) with Australia and trans-Tasman regulatory co-operation, consistent with the CER agreement of 1983, and the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement agreed in 1996. The Authority will be the first example of a true trans-Tasman authority that explicitly acknowledges joint co-operation between our 2 independent nations.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The establishment of the Authority will see New Zealand's  profile amongst the international therapeutics community increased. This will facilitate the export of therapeutic products beyond Australia. It will also offer more to other key regulators in terms of information sharing and potential for the Authority to develop mutual recognition agreements with other key regulators such as those in the US, Canada, and Europe. Greater regional and global influence over the development of international regulatory standards and harmonisation initiatives will also be provided.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Authority will be able to ensure that health and safety objectives are met without imposing unnecessary trade barriers. A credible trans-Tasman regulator will impose a quality standard that will be recognised and respected internationally. This will enable New Zealand firms to prove the quality of their products and make them more attractive in an international market.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The joint scheme will develop the therapeutic products industry in New Zealand, including research and development. The new scheme will mean that manufacturers only need to apply for one product approval in order to access both the Australian and New Zealand markets. It will mean that medicines approved for use in one country would also be approved for use in the other country, helping to limit the licensing and approval costs for the manufacturer and giving New Zealanders and Australians access to the same therapeutic products. Exporters will also have an assurance that products have a recognised regulatory stamp of approval for safety and quality.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Relationship between the Agreement, the Bill, and Rules and Orders</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Agreement between the two countries provides the framework for the joint scheme and the Authority by specifying the scope and framework, and accountability and governance arrangements, of the scheme. The vehicles for establishment under the Agreement are the Agreement itself, the implementing legislation, and jointly made Rules and Orders.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>The Agreement</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Agreement sets the scope of the regulatory model, which aims to protect public health and safety, and sets out the corporate governance structure for the Authority. It is through the governance structure that New Zealand sovereignty is managed. The Agreement thus lies at the heart of the model, as it provides for symmetry in relation to the control of the Authority through the Ministerial Council and the Board. The Agreement—</text>

          <text>The Ministerial Council and its functions are established under the Agreement. The Ministerial Council comprises the Australian and New Zealand Ministers of Health. Its primary role is to oversee the joint scheme. The Agreement also provides for the appointment of a Board of the Authority comprising 5 members. This includes the Managing Director of the Authority. The Managing Director is the chief executive of the Authority and is accountable to the Board for financial and administrative matters. A range of expert advisory committees will provide advice to the Managing Director in relation to regulatory decisions.</text>

These instruments, and any changes made to them over time, will be subject to scrutiny by the Parliaments in a similar way to domestic regulations. <emphasis style="italic">Part 1</emphasis> includes a discrete disallowance regime to enable this to occur.</text>

The starting point for the enforcement regime was the Australian Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, which is a more comprehensive regime than the one set out in the New Zealand Medicines Act 1981.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Part 2</emphasis>, therefore, provides for an enhanced enforcement regime. In some cases, this has resulted in higher penalties for significant breaches of the law (eg, counterfeiting medicines). This is a benefit of the new joint scheme to New Zealand, where enforcement powers and options have previously been seen to be limited. New Zealand has been fortunate not to experience significant non-compliance problems such as have occurred in Australia and internationally, but New Zealand cannot be complacent.

However, the Bill recognizes the value of a broad-based approach to addressing non-compliance. <emphasis style="italic">Part 2</emphasis> provides an opportunity to introduce new enforcement options, short of formal court proceedings, designed to encourage and facilitate early correction of non-compliant activity, such as a non-compliance notice regime and the ability of the Authority to accept enforceable undertakings.</text>

          <text>The establishment of a new regulatory scheme for therapeutic products has provided an opportunity to update the Medicines Act 1981. Significant changes have not been recommended because the majority of provisions in the Medicines Act 1981 are sound.

Changes are also recommended to ensure that there is seamless and effective regulation of therapeutic products under <emphasis style="italic">Parts 1 to 5</emphasis> and <emphasis style="italic">Parts 6 and 7</emphasis>.

Accordingly, the proposed appeal structure for the new Medicines Act provides for the possibility of 2 appeals from a decision of the Director-General of Health (the licensing authority). A party may make a first appeal to the District Court. From there, a further appeal may be made to the High Court, but only on a question of law and with the leave of the Court.

These Rules, which are currently being drafted and consulted on, will prohibit the export of a therapeutic product without a product licence.

In particular, the export of medicine in the course of, or for the purpose of, retail sales, following internet sales, will largely be prohibited by the requirement that the exporter must hold a valid product licence.

The intention of this is to guard against inappropriate prescribing of medicines to overseas patients (regardless of whether the subsequent export of therapeutic products to the patients is also illegal). It would also allow for unusual but legitimate prescribing situations where a patient may not have had a face-to-face consultation with their prescriber (eg, a locum prescribing for someone in a remote area).</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Supply of unscheduled medicines from vending machines</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Since the Medicines Act came into force in 1981, the sale of unscheduled (general sales) medicines from outlets such as supermarkets, dairies, and petrol stations has become commonplace (eg, paracetamol). <emphasis style="italic">Parts 6 and 7</emphasis> recognise the supply of unscheduled medicines from vending machines, but prohibit the supply of scheduled medicines (eg, prescription medicines and pharmacy-only medicines) from vending machines unless permitted in accordance with regulations made under the legislation (ie, the sale of unscheduled medicines from a vending machine would be a controlled activity). The Bill therefore permits the sale, through vending machines, of the same range of medicines currently able to be sold in supermarkets. The risk arising from the supply of medicines from vending machines, which are securely sealed units dispensing one unit at a time, is likely to be less than the risk arising in retail outlets where medicines may be stored on low shelves and purchases of multiple packs are easily made.</text>

        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Parts 6 and 7</emphasis> include a new provision for a licence to sell medicines by retail to be issued to an outlet other than a pharmacy, where the Director-General considers this to be in the best interests of public health. This would be an extension to the current requirement that pharmacy-only medicines may only be sold from a pharmacy, or from a shop that is at least 10 kilometres, by the most practicable route from a pharmacy. This proposal would still enable licences to be issued in relation to shops in remote areas, but would also enable other outlets to be licensed to sell specific medicines where this was considered appropriate.</text>

        <para>
          <text><emphasis style="italic">Parts 6 and 7</emphasis> take a different approach to the current Medicines Act. Rather than prohibiting certain prescribed activities, the Bill provides that an activity can be undertaken unless it is prohibited. There are several provisions set out in the current Medicines Regulations 1984 which are elevated to <emphasis style="italic">Parts 6 and 7</emphasis>. These provisions involve quite invasive powers, which are more appropriately dealt with in primary legislation. For example, Regulation 31, which permits a Medical Officer of Health to serve a notice on any owner or occupier of a premise prohibiting the use of the premises for, or in connection, with the manufacture, storage, or packing of any medicine or related product for sale, where there are concerns about the construction or disrepair of the premises or the use or character of neighbouring premises, is elevated to the Bill.</text>

Products and activities that were lawful before the Scheme starts will be deemed to have been granted a <def-term id="DLM1046451">transitional approval</def-term> by the Authority on the day the Scheme starts. The effect of a transitional approval is to largely maintain the legal status quo for the product or activity to which it relates. This means that if, under the Medicines Act 1981 (the <def-term id="DLM1046452">former Act</def-term>), a product could be lawfully supplied subject to certain conditions, then after the start date the product can lawfully continue to be supplied as long as those conditions are met.

          <text>New Zealand's  regulatory framework for therapeutic products is outdated, unsustainable and in need of reform.

In addition, while the basic regulatory framework for pharmaceuticals is sound, its operation is unsustainable.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Pharmaceuticals (prescription and over-the-counter medicines) have significant health benefits, but can present serious risks, especially if used inappropriately. Before a pharmaceutical product can be offered for supply in New Zealand, the distributor must obtain the consent of the Minister of Health. Applications for consent are assessed by Medsafe to ensure that the benefits of use outweigh the risks if the product is used appropriately, and to identify any appropriate special requirements or restrictions on supply.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>While the current regulatory approach is consistent with international best practice, the regime is unsustainable for New Zealand. As pharmaceuticals become increasingly complex and sophisticated, it is becoming increasingly difficult for New Zealand to maintain the expertise necessary to evaluate new products when such expertise is in short supply globally. Without adequate technical expertise, Medsafe will be unable to meet the regulatory objectives for pharmaceuticals within acceptable time-frames.</text>

          <text>In New Zealand, complementary medicines are currently marketed as foods under the Dietary Supplements Regulations 1985 (made under the Food Act 1981). The concerns with this regime are as follows:</text>

              <para>
                <text>therapeutic claims on dietary supplements are prohibited. However, in practice only a low level of enforcement has been possible and many are marketed with therapeutic claims, some of which are inaccurate, misleading or potentially dangerous. There is currently widespread and constant distribution (in leaflets and magazines, and on websites) of advertisements for complementary medicines making unsubstantiated therapeutic claims including those for the prevention or treatment of serious diseases such as cancer, tuberculosis, diabetes, heart disease and obesity:</text>

                <text>manufacturing standards for food are not adequate for complementary medicines presented in pharmaceutical dose forms, where appropriate formulation, quality in the manufacturing process, and accuracy of labelling and dosage are essential to the safety, effectiveness and appropriate use of the product. It is estimated that up to 10% of the total retail sales value of dietary supplements in New Zealand comes from products manufactured in premises in New Zealand or overseas that do not meet the New Zealand Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Manufacture and Distribution of Therapeutic Goods (<def-term id="DLM1046482">Good Manufacturing Practice</def-term>) standards. Consumers purchasing products have no way of identifying which products are of high quality and therefore safe to use:</text>

              <para>
                <text>there is no requirement for new ingredients used in dietary supplements to undergo any pre-market safety assessment, or for products to be registered. There is therefore no safety check on ingredients being used, and no register of products or distributors to facilitate efficient investigation and product recall when a safety alert arises:</text>

              <para>
                <text>because it is illegal to make therapeutic claims for dietary supplements, manufacturers and distributors are unable to lawfully provide consumers with the information they need to choose products wisely and use them safely.

          <text>Medical devices include products ranging from very low risk (eg, gauze dressings) to high-risk devices such as heart valves, which, if they fail, could lead to severe harm or death, with all the associated personal and social costs.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In contrast to most developed countries, New Zealand does not require medical devices to be approved before being marketed. Medsafe's  role is limited to market surveillance and dealing with safety issues as they emerge. Because there is no register of medical devices, this is inefficient and costly.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The vast majority of medical devices are imported, mainly from the US, Europe, Japan, and Australia, where devices are required to be registered. Most medical devices in use in New Zealand would therefore meet adequate safety standards, particularly as world standards converge around the Global Harmonization Task Force (<def-term id="DLM1046483">GHTF</def-term>) requirements. However, without similar standards applying in New Zealand, there is a risk that poor quality product that cannot be sold overseas will be dumped on the New Zealand market, with potentially serious health risks. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that the overall risk to consumers from medical devices is increasing.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Magnitude of risk</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Risk cannot be eliminated. From society's  point of view, the objective is to achieve an appropriate risk reduction at reasonable cost. While lack of data makes it difficult to quantify the risk for complementary medicines and medical devices, the risk can be significant, resulting in serious injury and death.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In most developed countries, regulatory arrangements for therapeutic products are predicated on the assumption that the costs of harm are likely to be far greater than the costs of policies aimed at reducing risk. For medical devices and complementary medicines, New Zealand's  regulatory regime is out of step with international practice and World Health Organization recommendations. Given the rising risk profile as products become more widely used and more sophisticated, and the existing evidence of problems and their consequences (discussed above), there is a prima facie case for policy intervention.</text>

        <para>
          <text>There are no non-regulatory options that would adequately achieve the health and safety objectives.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In an unregulated but highly competitive market, there would be a lack of incentive for suppliers of therapeutic products to provide balanced information about the benefits and risks of their products. Consumers would find it extremely difficult or impossible to identify quality product from substandard and potentially harmful product, or to take a case under consumer protection legislation because of the high burden of proof required.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Public education programmes (designed to enable consumers to evaluate the benefits and risks of products, make informed choices and use products safely), would not be effective, since most consumers do not have the knowledge or skills required to assess the accuracy or completeness of the available information or to interpret that information appropriately.</text>

          <text>Four regulatory options have been identified.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Continuation of the status quo</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Under this option the main focus would be on evaluating and approving pharmaceuticals and on post-market monitoring functions. There would be no pre-market requirements for medical devices. Dietary supplements would remain under food legislation with therapeutic claims prohibited. The current Medsafe budget is $6.7 million, of which $2.9 million is Crown funding and the remainder comes from fees paid by industry.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Enhancing the regulatory framework, with local evaluation to international standards</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Under this option, the regulatory framework would be extended to incorporate pre- and post-market controls for the full range of therapeutic products—prescriptions and over-the-counter medicines, complementary medicines and medical devices. There would be local evaluation to international standards, and mutual recognition arrangements with other reputable regulators for some aspects (such as evaluation of medical devices and assessment of good manufacturing practice).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A global shortage of expertise in evaluating increasingly specialised high-tech products makes it unlikely Medsafe could recruit the additional staff required under this option. The estimated budget for Medsafe regulating the full range of therapeutic products to international standards is $43 million per annum.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Enhancing the regulatory framework, but adopting a unilateral recognition scheme</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Under this option, the regulatory framework would be extended to incorporate pre- and post-market controls for the full range of therapeutic products. Local evaluation would not occur. Instead, evaluations carried out by competent overseas regulatory authorities would be recognised by Medsafe. Products intended only for the New Zealand market and not approved by any of the recognised overseas authorities would be evaluated under contracts with other regulators that would be managed by Medsafe.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>New Zealand would maintain a list of overseas regulatory authorities in whom it had confidence, and only evaluations carried out by those authorities would be recognised for the purposes of approving products for the New Zealand market. New Zealand would have no input into the standards or procedures adopted by those overseas authorities, and no direct access to their medical and scientific expertise. The scheme would be backed up by enhanced local post-market surveillance in recognition of the increased potential for New Zealand to receive product that did not match the safety, quality and efficacy standards of that originally evaluated.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The estimated annual budget for Medsafe operating a unilateral recognition scheme covering all therapeutic products is $29.4 million.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Establishing a joint Australia/New Zealand therapeutic products agency</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Under this option, New Zealand and Australia would adopt a single comprehensive regulatory scheme for all therapeutic products marketed in either country. The scheme would be administered by a single trans-Tasman regulatory agency, applying international best practice.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The agency would operate on the basis of full cost recovery with an estimated annual budget of $68 million. The New Zealand industry's  share of these costs is estimated at $20 million per annum, based on the assumption that 30% of product licence holders will be based in New Zealand.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Ministers agreed in principle to the establishment of a joint trans-Tasman agency to regulate therapeutic products supplied in Australian and New Zealand markets in December 2000, subject to the development of governance arrangements satisfactory to New Zealand.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The proposed governance arrangements would ensure an equal voice for each country through a Ministerial Council consisting of the Australian Commonwealth and New Zealand Ministers of Health. A Board, appointed by the Ministerial Council, would be accountable to the Ministerial Council for the strategic and financial direction of the agency. The Managing Director would be accountable to the Board for financial and administrative matters, and would be the statutory decision maker accountable to stakeholders through an internal appeal process as well as external judicial review and merits review mechanisms.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Options for resolving the existing special exemption under the TTMRA</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The current Special Exemption for therapeutic products will expire on 30 April 2007 and a further 12-month extension will be sought. The longer-term options are permanent exemption, harmonisation of regulatory requirements, or mutual recognition.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Mutual recognition is not a feasible option because New Zealand does not have a sustainable regulatory capacity, the regulatory frameworks are not matched, and there is not an acceptable level of confidence that equivalent regulatory outcomes are achievable under the existing separate schemes. Creation of a joint regulatory scheme is a specialised form of harmonisation that would achieve the trade objectives of the TTMRA, whereas permanent exemption would maintain current trade barriers.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Net benefit of the proposal</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>A lack of accurate data about some sectors of the therapeutic products industry, the products they market, and the risks arising from use of those products means that any analysis of the costs and benefits is reliant on a qualitative assessment of whether or not any change from the status quo would be of net benefit to New Zealand society. This assessment involves making a judgement about—</text>

              </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Enhancing the regulatory framework with local evaluation to international standards would fail to meet public health and safety objectives, as it would not be viable in light of the global shortage of appropriate expertise. It is already very difficult to get the expertise needed to evaluate pharmaceutical products to international standards in a timely fashion, and the situation is expected to get worse over time. The same problem would occur with high-risk medical devices. Compliance costs would be high, and existing trade barriers would be maintained.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Enhancing the regulatory framework, but adopting a unilateral recognition scheme could meet public health and safety objectives and be sustainable over time. It would, however, result in a loss of New Zealand's  ability to reach independent decisions about therapeutic products supplied in New Zealand or to have any voice in deciding the standards applied in evaluating products. Because of the need for enhanced post-market activities, compliance costs would be high. Existing trade barriers would be maintained and could increase if New Zealand was seen to be adopting a third-world approach to therapeutic product regulation.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Establishing a joint Australia/New Zealand therapeutic products agency would meet public health and safety objectives, and be sustainable over time. While there would be a risk that the joint scheme may not always result in decisions that were the best fit for New Zealand, this risk would be managed by ensuring New Zealand had an equal voice and there was no lesser accountability to Government, stakeholders and the public than at present. An opt-out mechanism would ensure that New Zealand would not be forced to adopt a position to which it had a fundamental objection.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The economies of scale and removal of duplication that would result from regulating jointly with Australia would lower overall administrative and compliance costs. The actual impact on New Zealand would depend on how the costs were shared between the two countries in the longer term, but the overall compliance costs for New Zealand industry would be lower in a joint scheme.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The joint agency option would also meet CER objectives. The immediate impact on trade is likely to be small, given New Zealand's  significant reliance on imports from across the globe. An approval from a trans-Tasman regulator with international credibility may make it easier for local manufacturers to break into export markets. However, compared with the status quo, the added compliance costs for medical devices and complementary medicines would reduce export competitiveness and local profitability, which could result in some beneficial products not being marketed locally, and some businesses in those sectors closing.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Medsafe has consulted widely in developing these proposals. In 2000, Medsafe published a discussion document seeking comment on the proposed form of a joint therapeutic products agency. This informed decisions by Ministers in December 2000. In further developing its proposals Medsafe has held regular meetings with consultative groups comprising representatives of the key stakeholder groups affected by the proposal, primarily therapeutic products suppliers. In December 2001 and June 2002, Medsafe distributed further discussion documents, seeking feedback on the design and role of the proposed agency.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Response to discussion paper released in June 2002</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>While a large number of responses was received, fewer than 15% were commenting on the proposals set out in the discussion paper. Government departments, representative bodies, consumer groups and those in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries broadly supported the proposals.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The bulk of the responses came from consumers, health practitioners and industry players from the complementary medicines sector who did not appear to have seen the proposals in the discussion paper but were reacting to some of the misinformation being circulated during the consultation period. They claimed there was no risk and therefore no need to regulate complementary medicines. They were fearful of increasing prices and decreasing product choice, and objected to decisions about which products they could access being made by an Australian bureaucrat.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Opinion expressed in submissions on the proposals contained in the discussion paper ranged from strong support for the proposals, to support for some aspects and concern about others, to outright rejection of any proposal to enter into a joint agency arrangement with Australia. All sectors of industry rejected the concept of 100% cost recovery, and there was considerable concern about Australian domination and loss of voice for New Zealand, although much of this concern was based on a misunderstanding of both the current system and the proposed governance and accountability arrangements.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Pharmaceutical sector</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The pharmaceutical industry generally supported the proposals, although there was some concern about loss of expertise within New Zealand. Most of the comments related to more detailed aspects that would be the subject of further consultation with stakeholders as subordinate legislation is developed.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Medical device sector</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The medical device industry strongly supported the adoption of the GHTF approach to device regulation and was broadly supportive of the joint agency proposals, provided certain aspects of the detail of the regulatory scheme for medical devices can be satisfactorily resolved.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Complementary medicines sector</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Opinion amongst those with an interest in the complementary medicines sector was divided. Some rejected any proposal to regulate the sector at all, although much of the industry supported regulation of product quality and claims, recognising that while the ingredients were generally very safe, there were risks from poor quality products and outrageous claims, and these were damaging to the industry.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Much of the negative comment centred on the current Australian regulatory scheme, which was seen as draconian, bureaucratic and expensive. There was considerable concern about the impact of compliance costs on small businesses, with claims that hundreds of small distributors would go out of business if the proposed scheme were introduced.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The larger manufacturing companies (about 10 companies that account for around 80% of the total market value) are broadly supportive of the joint agency concept and the overall approach to regulation. Most of their concerns relate to the detail of how the scheme would be administered and how the agency's  accountability to the fee-paying industry would be ensured.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There is no accurate record of the number of small manufacturers and importers who account for the remaining 20% of the market, although it is estimated there could be more than 200 small businesses involved. It was claimed that many of the products they distribute would be low value/low volume products that would not be viable in a regulated market. It is therefore likely that rationalisation of large product ranges or multiple distributors of the same or very similar products would result in some job losses for this group. The impact on importers and small manufacturers would depend on the size and distribution of fees, and on some aspects of the detail of the regulatory scheme, such as labelling requirements and interpretation of the Code of Good Manufacturing Practice.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There was support for the concept of a joint regulatory scheme for aspects such as advertising controls, adverse reactions monitoring and scheduling of medicines, but mandatory licensing of export-only products was considered inappropriate as it would not facilitate export or add any value for exporters.</text>

                <text>about 78 pharmaceutical companies and 24 pharmaceutical manufacturing sites with total industry turnover of around $900 million per annum. Two large manufacturing companies are New Zealand based, and are exporting to Australia. Almost all of the remainder are multinational companies marketing in both New Zealand and Australia. Only a small percentage would be expected to maintain separate products licences in the two countries, so that rationalisation of products and regulatory activities will result in reduced compliance costs. Compliance costs will increase for the few companies whose products are only available in New Zealand:</text>

Because the industry is so diverse and is not currently regulated in New Zealand, it has not been possible to obtain complete and accurate information about the numbers and types of businesses involved. During research for the cost benefit analysis, it was found that there were no official statistics and no comprehensive and reliable data available from industry organisations. Information provided by industry members was inconsistent and sometimes contradictory.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>For companies trading in both countries, the extent to which compliance costs will increase will depend on the degree of overlap in product ranges between the two markets, which is currently unknown.

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>For the unknown number of local manufacturers who do not currently meet Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, costs will vary depending on the extent to which they need to upgrade their premises in order to obtain a manufacturing licence. The greatest impact will be on smaller businesses requiring significant upgrading.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Compliance costs should not change significantly for those companies importing product from Australia (estimated to account for 50% of the total value of imports). For companies importing products from countries other than Australia, the greatest compliance cost impact would fall on businesses with a large product range.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The proposed annual product licence fee is intended to cover the costs of post-market activities such as adverse reactions monitoring, product testing, and handling complaints and recalls. If there were a standard fee per product, the impact would be greatest for those companies with large product ranges, and particularly for those that also had a small annual turnover. Possible mechanisms for managing the impact of compliance costs on small businesses include a fee waiver for low value/low volume products, or charging each company a fee based on a percentage of turnover. The latter is based on the premise that the costs of post-market activities relating to a company's  products will be proportional to the level of risk exposure and therefore to the volume of product the company has in the marketplace.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Key issues identified in consultation</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Complementary medicines/dietary supplements are viewed by the industry as very low risk. A number of stakeholders questioned the need for additional regulation, particularly if the Dietary Supplements Regulations 1985 were updated. Industry members are concerned that a number of small suppliers in New Zealand, particularly importers, would be likely to exit the market as a result of the additional costs from the proposed regulation. This would be primarily a distributional issue, as most ingredients in imported products are likely to be available in locally manufactured products, and where this is not the case, larger firms would introduce substitutes for affected product lines where sufficient profits could be made. However, some low value/low volume products would be likely to be removed from the market.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The major source of concern for the other sectors is the magnitude of fees. The Medical Industry Association of New Zealand (representing the medical device industry) raised concerns that fees may force many small importers out of business and reduce the range of product available in New Zealand. The Association is also concerned that the proposed harmonisation with Australia would cause many international device manufacturers to cancel contracts with New Zealand-based distributors, and rely on their distributors in Australia to supply product in both countries. The latter appears unlikely, however, as there is nothing to prevent this happening now.</text>

          <text>Some dietary supplement manufacturers are also covered by regulations administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry covering meat and dairy based products. However, those controls would not be duplicated by the proposed joint agency controls.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The Environmental Risk Management Authority (<def-term id="DLM1046487">ERMA</def-term>) regulates products incorporating genetically modified organisms. Medicines and medical devices using genetically modified organisms must gain approval from ERMA and from the regulator of therapeutic products before being marketed in New Zealand, as each agency is regulating different aspects of product safety.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Steps to minimise compliance costs</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>All options employ a risk-based approach, with pre-market entry requirements based on the level of risk. Under the proposed product licensing scheme, suppliers of low-risk therapeutic products would be able to self-certify that the product met specified requirements, and subject to electronic validation of key requirements such as the licence status of the manufacturer, a product licence would be issued immediately. In this way, pre-market evaluation of individual products and delays in getting the product to market would be avoided for an estimated 95% of complementary medicines and a significant proportion of medical devices.</text>

          <text>There will be a period of transition during which firms will be able to learn about the requirements, compile the required information, and adjust their production, labelling and distribution processes. There would be no application fee for existing complementary medicines and medical devices to get onto an interim product licence register. They could continue to be sold in New Zealand during the transition period. Once full compliance with the joint agency's  requirements was achieved, a joint agency product licence would be issued and the product could then be sold in both countries. Annual licence fees would apply from commencement of the new scheme, but there would be no initial licensing fee for products that are not currently required to be registered.</text>

        <para>
          <text>It is proposed to amend the Medicines Regulations 1984 to enable establishment of a register of medical devices as an interim step towards GHTF-style device regulation. There would be no fee for placing devices on the register. This would facilitate transition to the proposed joint agency regulatory scheme, and is well supported by the medical device industry. Many medical devices have a relatively short lifespan and will have been superseded by newer products before the transition period expires.</text>

Regulation 27 prohibits people with communicable diseases (and other conditions) from engaging in, or being employed in, the sale, manufacture, packing, labelling, storage or supply of medicines. Regulation 28 empowers Medical Officers of Health to serve written notices on those who have been in contact with such people and prevent them from engaging or being employed in the same activities.

              <para>
                <text>the prescribing controls in regulation 39 of the Medicines Regulations 1984 are too restrictive in 3 respects. Firstly, the regulation restricts dentists to prescribing prescription medicines only for dental treatment. This means that a dentist cannot prescribe for an associated condition, such as preventing or treating a side effect caused by a medicine used for dental treatment. The patient must be referred to a medical practitioner for such treatment. Similarly, registered midwives are restricted to prescribing for antenatal, intrapartum and post-natal care. Secondly, the regulation restricts a dentist to prescribing for a maximum treatment period of 10 days (5 days and a repeat of 5 days), whereas other existing prescribers may prescribe up to 3 months' treatment (or 6 months for an oral contraceptive). These restrictions on dentist prescribing are no longer appropriate given the changes to the practice of dentistry and the medicines used in dental treatment. Thirdly, the regulation restricts the period of supply of a prescription medicine that can be prescribed by a medical practitioner or registered midwife to 3 months (or 6 months for an oral contraceptive prescribed by a medical practitioner). This restriction can create a safety risk for New Zealanders travelling for extended periods to places where there is no reliable source of the medicines they require for the treatment of an ongoing condition (eg, army personnel serving overseas for an extended period of time).</text>

          <text>Subsidisation under the Pharmaceutical Schedule for prescriptions written by dentists is currently limited to 10 days (5 days and a repeat). If PHARMAC was to remove this restriction to bring subsidy rules into line with legal prescribing rights, there should be no increased cost to the pharmaceutical budget. The proposed change to dentist prescribing will mean a shift in who prescribes longer-term treatments, rather than altering the number of patients requiring treatment, the medicines prescribed, or the length of the treatment period. There is potential for cost savings because consumers will only need one prescription to cover the required treatment period, rather than repeat dispensings or multiple prescriptions. In addition, patients will not require a consultation with a medical practitioner, resulting in a cost saving where the patient qualifies for a subsidy. PHARMAC will monitor the impact of dentist prescribing on the pharmaceutical budget in accordance with its operating procedures following any change in the subsidisation rules. If there is a concern about expenditure, PHARMAC may still act to re-impose restrictions on access to subsidies.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Changing the prescribing restrictions for dentists and midwives will align the regulatory arrangements for dentists and midwives with those for other existing prescribers. The change should not impact significantly on the dental registering authority, the Dental Council of New Zealand, as they are already well advanced in the process of defining scopes of practice for dentists and dental specialists (eg, orthodontists, dental surgeons). There is not likely to be a resulting increase in Dental Council registration fees for dentists. Using the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 instead of the Medicines Regulations 1984 to regulate prescribing by midwives would not affect the scope of midwifery prescribing and is supported by the Midwifery Council.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Consumers will benefit from a reduction in costs arising from changes to the prescribing rules for dentists. Savings will arise because there will no longer be a requirement for multiple prescriptions to cover an extended treatment period, or the need to consult a medical practitioner for treatment of a condition related to dental treatment. There may be benefits to the health sector overall through a reduction in secondary illnesses or complications as a result of dentists being able to prescribe prompt and appropriate treatment. There may also be benefits to consumers of medicines through the proposed changes to the offences/penalties regime because this should deter offending under the Act, therefore enhancing consumer safety.</text>

        <para>
          <text>In late 2002, Medsafe undertook a targeted consultation with key health professional groups and stakeholders on ways to update or improve the parts of the Medicines Act 1981 that would not be covered by the new joint regulatory regime. A discussion paper was produced after meetings with key sector players, including the councils for the different health professions (eg, the Medical Council, the Dental Council). The paper was also circulated to District Health Boards, universities, and other stakeholders with a direct interest. This was thought to be appropriate given the limited nature of the change and the fact that the main reforms were as a result of the joint scheme.</text>

          <text>The consultation emphasised that the focus was not on radically overhauling the New Zealand-specific medicines legislation, or making significant policy changes.
