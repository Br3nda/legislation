          <text>This Bill is an omnibus Bill that will amend the Trade Marks Act 2002 and the Copyright Act 1994. It is intended that the Bill be divided into 2 separate Bills at the committee of the whole House stage: a Trade Marks (International Treaties and Enforcement) Amendment Bill and a Copyright Amendment Bill.</text>

          <text>A trade mark is a unique identifier (such as a word, brand, logo, colour, slogan, three-dimensional shape or even a sound) that enables a business to easily distinguish its goods and services from those supplied by other traders. It is used in marketing to provide consumer recognition that goods and services of a given quality originate from a particular trader.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Madrid Protocol</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Madrid Protocol provides a system that simplifies the procedures required for a trade mark owner to protect his or her trade marks overseas. Joining the Madrid Protocol will provide New Zealand trade mark owners with the possibility of having their trade marks protected overseas by filing 1 application for registration of a trade mark with the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand and designating one or more overseas countries who are also members of the Madrid Protocol where protection is sought. Overseas trade mark owners would also be able to use the Madrid Protocol to protect their trade marks in New Zealand.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Joining the Madrid Protocol would also simplify the subsequent management of overseas registered trade marks. It is possible to renew or record subsequent changes to the trade mark registration in each country using the Madrid Protocol through a single procedural step, rather than making a request directly in each country.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill introduces amendments to the Trade Marks Act to facilitate the implementation of the international registration regime for trade marks under the Madrid Protocol, including providing for regulations to be made for the purposes of giving effect to New Zealand's obligations under the Madrid Protocol. </text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Nice Agreement</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Nice Agreement provides a classification system for goods and services for the purposes of registering trade marks (the <emphasis style="bold">Nice Classification</emphasis>). Those countries that are party to the Nice Agreement must apply the Nice Classification to registered trade marks, although those countries not party may still apply the Nice Classification. New Zealand has applied the Nice Classification to registered trade marks for many years.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Nice Classification is updated on a 5 yearly cycle and parties to the Nice Agreement meet on a semi-regular basis to consider amendments to it. By becoming party to the Nice Agreement New Zealand would be permitted to participate in those meetings and potentially influence the future development of the Nice Classification so that it best meets the needs of New Zealand businesses.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill clarifies that the latest edition of the Nice Classification must be used with all new applications for the registration of a trade mark under the Trade Marks Act.</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Singapore Treaty</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The Singapore Treaty aims to make national trade mark registration systems more user-friendly and to reduce business compliance costs for trade mark owners. It does this through the simplification and international harmonisation of national registration procedures. The Singapore Treaty does not, however, seek to harmonise substantive trade mark law. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The majority of the standards and rules in the Singapore Treaty relate to the procedures of trade marks offices and, in particular, are constructed to make clear what a trade marks office can and cannot require from applicants. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Ratifying the Singapore Treaty enables New Zealand to contribute to the realisation of the treaty’s aim to make national and regional trade mark registration systems more user-friendly. Joining the Singapore Treaty provides an opportunity for New Zealand to send a clear signal to the international community of its commitment to provide an efficient and effective trade mark registration regime that is consistent with international practice.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill contains amendments to the Trade Marks Act, including providing for regulations to be made, for the purpose of giving effect to New Zealand’s obligations under the Singapore Treaty that will bring it into conformity with the standards and rules set out in the Singapore Treaty. </text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Enforcement</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>There is a growing problem around the world relating to the manufacture, distribution, and sale of counterfeits. New Zealand is experiencing a similar steady growth in the sale of counterfeits; most being sourced from overseas.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The illegitimate sale of counterfeits deprives trade mark and copyright owners and their licensees (<quote.in quote="1">right holders</quote.in>) and legitimate retailers of income and, therefore, ultimately undermines the profitability of businesses. In addition to having a wider negative economic impact, the sale of counterfeits can lead to an entrenchment in society of the acceptance and consumption of counterfeits, which is likely to result in health and safety risks because of poor materials and substandard processes used in the manufacture of counterfeits, and a disregard for the law. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Consistent with New Zealand’s international obligations under Article 61 of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, both the Trade Marks Act and the Copyright Act include criminal offences for cases of wilful counterfeiting or piracy on a commercial scale. Penalties for a person convicted of manufacturing, importing and/or selling counterfeits consist of fines of up to $150,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill will empower the Ministry and Customs to play an active role in enforcing the criminal offences under the Trade Marks Act and the Copyright Act alongside and in co-operation with other enforcement agencies and right holders. The focus for Customs enforcement will be at the border, whilst the Ministry will focus its efforts on post-border enforcement. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The enforcement powers contained in this Bill will provide the Ministry and Customs with warranted search and seizure powers and the ability to share information with other enforcement agencies, such as the New Zealand Police, to assist in identifying persons involved in the commissioning of a criminal offence.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Customs is to be provided with non-warranted powers to seize counterfeits when counterfeits come within the control of Customs at the border.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Furthermore, there are a range of circumstances where applying for and executing a search warrant by the Ministry would be impractical, because of the transient and itinerant nature of offenders selling counterfeits and the nature of some counterfeits, which can pose a public health and safety risk. In order to address this type of offending, the Bill provides the Ministry with some limited powers to undertake search and seizure of counterfeits being offered for sale within areas and at places open to the public without a search warrant. </text>

It sets out a single ground for revocation on the basis of non-use, namely that the trade mark has not, during a continuous period of 3 years or more, been put to genuine use in the course of trade in New Zealand by the owner of the mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which it was registered. <emphasis style="italic">New subsection (1A)</emphasis> defines a continuous period for the purposes of <emphasis style="italic">new section 66(1)(a)</emphasis>.</text>

          <text>A trade mark is a unique identifier (word, brand, logo, colour, slogan, three-dimensional shape, and sometimes even a sound) that enables a business to easily distinguish its goods and services from those supplied by other traders. It is used as a marketing tool so that consumers can recognise the product of a particular trader, thereby providing low cost information to consumers and creating incentives for business to invest in quality products and services. During the financial year ending 30 June 2005, the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (<emphasis style="bold">IPONZ</emphasis>) received 27 937 applications to register trade marks, registered 21 089 trade marks and received renewal notices for 10 014 trade mark registrations.</text>

        <para>
          <text>In March 2006, member states, which include New Zealand and Australia, of the World Intellectual Property Organization (<emphasis style="bold">WIPO</emphasis>) adopted at the conclusion of a Diplomatic Conference the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks (the <emphasis style="bold">Singapore Treaty</emphasis>). The Singapore Treaty aims to make national trade mark registration systems more user-friendly and to reduce business compliance costs, both for applicants for the registration of a trade mark and for trade mark registrants. This is achieved through the simplification and international harmonisation of trade mark registration procedures. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The majority of the provisions in the Singapore Treaty relate to the procedures of trade mark offices and, in particular, they are constructed to make it clear what a trade mark office can and cannot require from an applicant for registration of a trade mark or a trade mark registrant. While the Trade Marks Act 2002 (the <emphasis style="bold">Trade Marks Act</emphasis>) incorporates many of the standards prescribed by the Singapore Treaty, there are a number of provisions that either do not currently meet those standards or are inconsistent with international best practice. Therefore unless New Zealand amends the Trade Marks Act it is unable to join the Singapore Treaty.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Currently the regulation making powers only enable procedures, requirements and other matters to be prescribed for the division of an application for registration of a trade mark into several applications. No provision is made for the owner of a trade mark registration to be able to divide his or her registration into 2 or more registrations. The Singapore Treaty requires that such a provision be available to registrants. </text>

        </explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Trade Marks Act only permits the new owner of a trade mark to whom title to the trade mark has been assigned or transmitted may apply to the Commissioner of Trade Marks (the <emphasis style="bold">Commissioner</emphasis>) for registration of the person’s title. There is no fee payable to register an assignment or transmission of title. No provision is made for a person assigning or transmitting title to a trade mark (the <emphasis style="bold">previous owner</emphasis>) to another person to apply to register the change in ownership of a trade mark. The Singapore Treaty requires a trade mark office to accept an application to register a change of ownership from either the previous owner or the new owner. </text>

        <explnote.subhead2>
          <emphasis style="roman">Registration of a person as a licensee:</emphasis>
        </explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Singapore Treaty does not require that provision be made for licensees to be registered, but if registration is provided then contracting parties must adhere to certain standards and rules, such as the maximum information a request to register a licensee may contain.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>While the Trade Marks Act provides that licensees may be voluntarily registered (there is no fee payable for doing this), the information that must be provided and the evidence requirements are different to those permitted by the Singapore Treaty. Furthermore, under the Trade Marks Act if the licensee is not registered, the licensee is barred from taking action against infringement of the registered trade mark and from lodging a border protection notice to prevent the importation of counterfeit goods. Furthermore, there is no requirement for licensees or trade mark owners to keep the information on registered licensees up to date, and there are business compliance costs associated with doing so. There are no statistics available on the number of licensees not registered in New Zealand or on the number of registered licensees where the information is not current.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In Australia, the registration of a licensee is not a prerequisite for a licensee to have the ability to take action against infringement of the trade mark or to lodge a border protection notice with Customs. The matter of whether a licensee can take action against infringement or lodge a border protection notice is determined first by the licence agreement between the trade mark owner and the licensee. Unregistered licensees in New Zealand are therefore at a disadvantage when compared to their equivalents in Australia.</text>

In addition, all existing registrations of licensees would be cancelled and removed from the trade marks register. The provisions in the Trade Marks Act governing the actions of licensees in respect of infringement and border protection measures be aligned with the Australian Trade Marks Act 1995 so that the matter of whether a licensee can take action against infringement or lodge a border protection notice is determined by the licence agreement between the trade mark owner and the licensee.</text>

          <text>A J Park were concerned amendment to section 82 to allow the original owner of title to a trade mark to register a change of ownership did not make practical sense and had the potential to cause difficulties for the new owner. It was suggested, for example, that there is potential for confusion if the new owner is not aware that an assignment has been recorded and the records of the entities involved are likely to be inconsistent and in some cases wrong. Officials note that the provisions in the Singapore Treaty regarding changes to ownership require a trade marks office to accept an application for change of ownership from either the original owner or the new owner.</text>

          <text>A J Park were also concerned that the original proposal in the discussion paper to align the provisions concerning the registration of a person as a licensee with the Australian Trade Marks Act 1995 would not result in any benefits and the registration of licensees often causes costs and confusion. Furthermore, they considered that the Commissioner should not play any role in between the trade mark owner and a licensee, and nor should there be any practical or legal effects from the registration of a licensee. It was their view that there were not any practical or legal effects at present. Officials agree with the A J Park's submission on the registration of licensees and the preferred option now proposes to remove the provisions relating to the voluntary registration of licenses and to cancel all existing licensee registrations.</text>

          <text>If an overseas business wants to protect its trade marks in New Zealand, it must apply directly to IPONZ and provide all information in English, pay prescribed fees in New Zealand dollars and comply with our unique procedural requirements. During the financial year ending 30 June 2005 IPONZ received 27 937 applications to register trade marks, registered 21 089 trade marks, and received renewal notices for 10 014 trade mark registrations. Approximately half of the applications to register trade marks originated from overseas businesses either trading in New Zealand, or looking to sell their goods and/or services in New Zealand.</text>

          <text>The WIPO administers the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (the <emphasis style="bold">Madrid Protocol</emphasis>) that provides access to the <quote.in quote="1">Madrid system</quote.in> for the international registration of trade marks. There are 68 countries party to the Madrid Protocol, including New Zealand’s leading trade partners. The Madrid system enables a trade mark owner to have a trade mark protected in one or more countries by filing one application (an <emphasis style="bold">international application</emphasis>) directly with his or her local trade mark office in English, French, or Spanish, paying 1 fee and designating 1 or more overseas countries where the Madrid system is available and where protection is sought.</text>

          <text>Anecdotal evidence from Australia following its accession to the Madrid Protocol suggests that New Zealand trade mark agents would face a short-term (around 1 to 2 years) reduction in revenue from overseas clients as those clients switch to using the Madrid system in New Zealand. The impact of any reduced revenue cannot be quantified, but is likely to be felt the most by smaller firms who may rely heavily on overseas trade mark work for a substantial portion of their income. Overseas experience suggests that this impact is likely to be mitigated over the longer term as some of the lost revenue can be expected to be recouped by additional work from both New Zealand and overseas businesses related to the greater utilisation of the Madrid system. Trade mark agents would also incur some business compliance costs, which are discussed further in the business compliance cost statement below.</text>

          <text>MED released a discussion paper entitled <emphasis style="italic">International Trade Mark Treaties</emphasis> in March 2006, which considered, amongst other things, New Zealand’s accession to the Madrid Protocol. Seven out of the eight submissions received on the Madrid Protocol supported accession. Submitters generally acknowledged that overseas businesses, rather than local businesses, would be more likely to use the Madrid system and benefit from New Zealand’s accession. They did, however, broadly support accession. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Submissions from New Zealand patent attorneys considered that New Zealand businesses and, in particular, their clients would not use the Madrid system to protect trade marks overseas, particularly because of their small size. They were concerned that few benefits would accrue for New Zealand businesses from accession. Officials note that the Madrid system is principally designed to assist exporting businesses and, in particular, the businesses exporting to several countries at a time. The greater the number of overseas markets being exported to, the greater the potential financial savings that can be achieved through using the Madrid system. While local businesses may not choose to use the Madrid system, officials believe that this does not justify preventing overseas businesses from taking advantage of the Madrid system to protect their trade marks in New Zealand.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Patent attorneys were also concerned that accession would result in a substantial reduction in revenue from overseas clients. For example, A J Park considered that accession to the Madrid Protocol would cost trade mark firms around $5 million annually, with flow-on effects such as loss of jobs. Officials note that this loss of revenue equates to the financial savings that would accrue to overseas businesses annually from New Zealand’s accession. A J Park conceded that protecting the income of New Zealand trade mark firms should not be a priority in determining whether New Zealand joined the Madrid Protocol. As noted above, overseas experience suggests that this loss in income would be mitigated over time.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Other concerns raised by patent attorneys were: that accession to the Madrid Protocol would result in more trade marks being registered in New Zealand, and thereby reduce the <quote.in quote="1">pool</quote.in> of available trade marks available to New Zealand businesses to use; that it would increase the number of trade marks registered in New Zealand that are not actually used; make it more difficult for trade mark firms to <quote.in quote="1">clear</quote.in> trade marks for use by New Zealand businesses; and increase the number of trade mark conflicts between businesses. Officials note that such issues are common to all businesses operating in larger markets than New Zealand and they are an unavoidable consequence of economic growth and increased global trade. Officials also note that trade mark firms are most likely to benefit from increased numbers of trade marks registered in New Zealand and any increase in trade mark conflicts between businesses.</text>

          <text>The Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks (the <emphasis style="bold">Nice Agreement</emphasis>) provides a classification system for goods and services for the purposes of registering trade marks (the <emphasis style="bold">Nice Classification</emphasis>). Countries that are party to the Nice Agreement must apply the Nice Classification to registered trade marks. Other countries are free to adopt and use the Nice Classification. Whilst New Zealand is not party to the Nice Agreement, the use of the Nice Classification has been mandated for many years under the Trade Marks Act 1953 (now repealed) and more recently under the Trade Marks Act.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Some 1 600 Third Schedule trade marks registrations are not classified under the Nice Classification. They were registered before 1953 and some date back to the beginning of the 20th century. These registrations prevent New Zealand from becoming party to the Nice Agreement. They also result in added administrative costs for the IPONZ, as it must maintain 2, rather than 1, searchable trade mark registers. The existence of 2 trade mark registers imposes time and search costs upon IPONZ (during the examination of applications to register trade marks) and the public, from having to understand and access 2 different classifications systems and from having to search 2 separate registers to find if a particular trade mark has been registered in New Zealand.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Furthermore, New Zealand has been unable to participate in the five-yearly cycle of reviews of the Nice Classification conducted by countries that are party to the Nice Agreement.

          <text>The <emphasis style="bold">Commissioner</emphasis> would write to each Third Schedule registrant and invite them to apply voluntarily to convert their registration into the Nice Classification. This option is also not preferred. While it is anticipated that some registrants would take up the Commissioner’s invitation, it is likely that some would not. Reasons for not taking up the invitation could include the cost of expert advice to determine the most appropriate Nice class(es) for the registration and/or that conversion may result in the registration being divided into several Nice classes, which would increase the renewal fees payable by the registrant.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Option 3 (preferred) – amend the Regulations</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Amend the Regulations to provide a procedure for the Commissioner to initiate the re-classification of Third Schedule registrations to the Nice Classification. The Commissioner would write to the registrant proposing a suitable Nice Classification and providing for the registrant to either accept the Nice class(es) as proposed or provide an alternative classification to the satisfaction of the Commissioner within a specified period. The normal appeal procedures specified in the Regulations would apply in situations where the registrant disagrees with the Commissioner’s decisions regarding conversion. Where a conversion results in a registration being converted into 2 or more classes of the Nice Classification system, additional renewal fees related to the number of classes would be payable upon the expiry of the registration.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The Commissioner would have a mechanism with which to convert all Third Schedule registrations into the Nice Classification in a timely manner. Having a single register of trade marks would reduce IPONZ administration costs and simplify searches of the trade marks register.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>IPONZ is fully third-party funded and there would be no financial implications for the government arising from amendments to the Trade Marks Act. There will be a minor cost to IPONZ associated with initiating the conversion of those trade mark registrations currently not classified in the Nice Classification. This cost would be met from within existing MED baselines. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Following conversion of Third Schedule registrations, New Zealand would be able to become party to the Nice Agreement and, therefore, be able to contribute to the future development of the Nice Classification. As the Nice Agreement does not seek to harmonise substantive trade mark law, joining would not impact on the Government’s ability to achieve specific policy objectives in the trade marks area, such as responding to Treaty of Waitangi claims.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Businesses</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>For the large majority of businesses who have registered trade marks or who use registered trade marks, there will be no costs arising from the conversion of the Third Schedule registrations into the Nice Classification. For the large majority of businesses, searching the trade mark register would become more efficient and effective as a result of needing to only search 1 register of trade marks under 1 classification system.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Following conversion and accession to the Nice Agreement, New Zealand businesses who own trade marks may benefit from New Zealand’s participation in the development of the Nice Classification, especially where classification issues arise from New Zealand vernacular not used elsewhere, or where businesses provide unique products or services not encompassed by the Nice Classification.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>There will be some minor unquantified costs for the owners of the 1 600 registered trade marks not classified under the Nice Classification, associated with identifying the most suitable classes of Nice Classifications into which their registration should be converted. Where conversion results in a registration being converted into several classes of the Nice Classification, the owner would need to pay additional fees to renew the registration. The fee for renewing a trade mark registration is $250 (exclusive of GST) per class (a trade mark may be registered for 1 or more classes of goods and/or services).</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Stakeholder consultation</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>MED released a discussion paper entitled <emphasis style="italic">International Trade Mark Treaties</emphasis> in March 2006, which considered, amongst other things, New Zealand’s accession to the Nice Agreement and key amendments that would be required to the Trade Marks Act and the Regulations to facilitate accession. Six submissions were received on the Nice Agreement. Submissions were generally in favour of conversion of the Third Schedule registrations into the Nice Classification and of New Zealand acceding to the Nice Classification.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Several submissions raised concerns at the possible costs to the 1 600 Third Schedule registrants arising from conversion. Some submissions suggested that additional renewal fees should be waived either at the first subsequent expiry of the registration or in perpetuity. Officials agree that some registrants would face additional renewal costs, but disagree that such registrants should be compensated. Where registrants of Third Schedule registrations have previously voluntarily converted their registrations into the Nice Classification, no compensation for additional renewal fees has been available. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Further, the registrants of Third Schedule registrations will have had the benefit of lower renewal fees than other owners for more than 50 years and should for the future be in the same position as other registrants with regards to renewal fees (ie, other registrants should not be required to subsidise Third Schedule registrants).</text>

        <explnote.subhead1>Business compliance cost statement</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>Overall there will be a reduction in compliance costs associated with searching a single trade marks register under 1 classification system. For the owners of the 1 600 trade marks not classified under the Nice Classification, there would be, in some cases, compliance costs associated with the process of conversion and, in particular, seeking expert advice from a trade mark agent to identify the most appropriate Nice class(es), because of the broad nature of specification of goods for which the trade mark is registered. The likely cost of seeking expert advice from a trade mark agent has not been quantified and is expected to vary depending of the complexity of classification issues that arise during the conversion processes.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>It is estimated that the owners of around 200 Third Schedule registrations may need to seek expert advice from a trade mark agent related to the conversion of their registrations. The size of the businesses affected is not known and the conversion process is likely to affect both New Zealand and overseas businesses. It is also likely that a small number of businesses will own 2 or more Third Schedule registrations.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Steps that will be taken to minimise compliance costs include: IPONZ providing information to affected Third Schedule registrants on the conversion process. In order to assist to reduce conversion costs for affected registrants, the Commissioner would initiate the conversion processes by suggesting an appropriate conversion to the registrant.</text>

        <para>
          <text>There is a growing problem around the world related to the manufacture, distribution, and sale of counterfeited goods and pirated works (<emphasis style="bold">counterfeits</emphasis>). For example, the World Customs Organization estimates counterfeiting and piracy accounts for 5 to 7% of global merchandise trade, estimated to be equivalent to lost sales of as much as US$512 billion. The World Health Organization estimates that up to 10% of medicines sold worldwide are counterfeit.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Goods typically targeted by counterfeiters are those items sold at “premium” prices and well in excess of the cost to manufacture. Counterfeits can provide a ready source of income for terrorist organisations and organised crime. Typically fashion clothing, footwear, fashion accessories (like perfume, sun glasses, hand bags, caps, watches, and jewellery), movies, music, and software are usually counterfeited. Many other types of goods, however, are also being counterfeited such as auto parts, motorcycles, cigarettes, cosmetics, medicines, sports equipment such as golf clubs, toys, and foodstuffs. Many of these items can pose serious health risks.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>New Zealand is not immune to the problem of counterfeits, although New Zealand does not yet appear to face problems associated with counterfeits that pose a risk to public safety such as medicines, foodstuffs, and auto and machinery parts. The New Zealand Customs Service (<emphasis style="bold">Customs</emphasis>) has reported that the volumes of counterfeited goods they have detained have risen by over 400% since July 2000 with over 260 000 items detained by them last year as suspected of being counterfeits. Since Customs works on an intelligence and risk assessment basis, and cannot inspect every shipment of goods entering New Zealand, the true volume of counterfeits will be substantially higher than detention statistics suggest.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The Trade Marks Act and the Copyright Act 1994 (the <emphasis style="bold">Copyright Act</emphasis>) provide criminal offences against the manufacture, importation and sale of counterfeits to deter the trade in counterfeits. <emphasis style="bold">MED</emphasis> has determined that the infrequent and ad hoc prosecutions by government agencies of these criminal offences is contributing to the growth of counterfeits being offered for sale in New Zealand. Greater volumes of counterfeits being offered for sale can lead to reduced profits by trade mark owners and copyright holders (<emphasis style="bold">right holders</emphasis>) and entrenchment in society of the acceptance and consumption of counterfeits, whilst ignoring the law, the potential health risks and the wider impacts on the economy as a whole.</text>

        <para>
          <text>This option was rejected because there was no guarantee that the additional resources provided would be used by police to prioritise enforcement of the criminal offences under the Trade Marks Act and the Copyright Act over all other forms of criminal offending.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This option was rejected because none of these other government agencies have available to them any investigative and prosecutorial powers to undertake any enforcement of the criminal offences under the Trade Marks Act and the Copyright Act.

          <text>This option is not preferred.

          <text>There are several reasons why the NEU is the preferred choice for making responsible enforcement. The Trade Marks Act and the Copyright Act are the primary responsibility of MED and the NEU is an established enforcement unit with the Ministry with a wide range of experience investigating and prosecuting various forms of regulatory crime. Furthermore, the NEU also has established links with other government agencies that have existing roles enforcing legislation against various forms of regulatory crime.</text>

          <text>Right holders are likely to benefit in a number of ways from enforcement action by NEU. While these benefits cannot be quantified, enforcement action by the NEU is expected to lead to a reduction in manufacture, importation, and sale of counterfeits in New Zealand through a deterrent effect. A reduction in the sale of counterfeits is likely to result in increased sales for right holders and increase their profits from the New Zealand market. A reduction in sales of counterfeits is also likely to increase the reputation of the quality of right holders’ goods, since right holders would not have to complete against poor quality “knock off” items being offered for sale. This in turn may also assist to increase sales for right holders.</text>

Stakeholders are broadly supportive of the proposal for NEU to play a role in the enforcement of the criminal offences under the Trade Marks Act and the Copyright Act and the proposed investigative and prosecutorial powers.</text>

        <explnote.crosshead>Executive summary</explnote.crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>Border interceptions of counterfeit and pirated goods by Customs contribute to a global partnership aimed at reducing this trade. A worldwide increase in the amount of counterfeit and pirated goods being traded, and the weak level of deterrence against such imports, has contributed to a backlog in Customs' workload. Allowing Customs to take some prosecutions related to imported counterfeit and pirated goods would be an effective way of helping to manage this problem. It is proposed that Customs is empowered to take such prosecutions. In many cases this would be more efficient than the police or the NEU of MED taking the prosecutions.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>To enable Customs to undertake this role it will require explicit supporting powers under the Trade Marks Act and the Copyright Act. The proposed supporting powers would enable Customs to undertake warranted searches, retain certain goods, require information to be supplied and to copy information.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.crosshead>Adequacy statement</explnote.crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>Customs has reviewed this Regulatory Impact Statement (<emphasis style="bold">RIS</emphasis>), and has determined it is adequate according to the criteria agreed by Cabinet. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Unit decided not to review this RIS because it considered the Cabinet paper's proposal would not significantly impact on economic growth.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.crosshead>Status quo and problem</explnote.crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>Internationally, trade in counterfeit and pirated goods has been increasing, with New Zealand subject to the same trend. In New Zealand volumes of trade mark and copyright infringing goods intercepted by Customs have continued to increase each year. In 2004/05 185 000 infringing items were detained by Customs. This increased to 260 000 items in 2005/06. The issue of trade in counterfeit and pirated goods is receiving increasing attention internationally, with governments around the world considering new measures to tackle the issue, including giving customs agencies the powers to take prosecutions and ex officio powers to act on their own behalf against trade mark and copyright importing infringements.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In August 2006 Cabinet agreed that the NEU of MED should be responsible for enforcing trade mark and copyright offences defined in the Trade Marks Act and the Copyright Act [CAB Min (06) 32/12]. This includes offences related to the importation of counterfeit and pirated goods. No additional funding has, however, been given to the NEU to undertake such enforcement action. The police is also able to use its general powers to enforce trade mark and copyright criminal offences, but resource constraints mean that investigations of this type are low priority.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Border interceptions of counterfeit and pirated goods by Customs contribute to a global partnership aimed at reducing trade in these goods.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Customs' current activities are based on the border protection measures set out in the Trade Marks Act and the Copyright Act. This legislation is consistent with measures described in the internationally recognised <emphasis style="italic">Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Including Trade in Counterfeit Goods</emphasis>. Customs' activities are predicated on rights owners lodging a notice requesting the detention of goods that appear to infringe their rights.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead1>Problem definition</explnote.subhead1>
        <para>
          <text>The global increase in trade of counterfeit and pirated goods, and the low level of deterrence against importing such goods into New Zealand, have contributed to some operational pressure within Customs. For example, there is a backlog of about 6 months in Customs' investigations of possible trade mark and copyright infringements. The backlog impacts on the availability of Customs' resources to undertake other types of work, such as drug and objectionable material investigations. It has also precipitated a shortage of secure storage facilities for detained goods.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>A few importers repeatedly import counterfeit and pirated goods. Although enforcement could be better managed by taking some prosecutions against such importations, and in most cases Customs is better placed than other agencies to do this, Customs is not currently able to take this action.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.crosshead>Objectives</explnote.crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>The main objective of the change being sought is to help to reduce the importation of counterfeit or pirated goods (as compared with the status quo). A secondary objective is to reduce the backlog in Customs' investigations of possible trade mark and copyright infringements.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.crosshead>Alternative options</explnote.crosshead>
        <explnote.subhead2>Alternative Option 1 – Increase Resources Allocated to Customs IPR Investigations</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Option 1 would not require legislative change. However it would not increase the deterrence against recidivist importers of counterfeit and pirated goods. Although an increase in resources might reduce the backlog of Customs investigations in the short term, any reduction is unlikely to be sustained over the medium and longer terms<footnote id="DLM1461705"><para><text>In the past year Customs realigned its investigative branch in an effort to better focus its resources.  This change was, in part, a response to increasing IPR detentions and the expectation that importations of counterfeit and pirated goods would continue to rise.  Following this realignment the backlog of IPR investigations initially decreased, but this trend was not sustained.  </text></para></footnote>.</text>
        </para>
        <explnote.subhead2>Alternative option 2 – Provide additional funding to the NEU, tagged for prosecuting importers of counterfeit or pirated goods</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Option 2 would not require legislative change. Although it would increase the level of enforcement against importers of counterfeit or pirated goods, it would not deliver the outcomes sought in the most efficient way.  This is because in most cases Customs will already be in possession of the necessary information and evidence to prosecute importers of counterfeit and pirated goods.</text>
