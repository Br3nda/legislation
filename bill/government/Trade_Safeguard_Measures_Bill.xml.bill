          <text>This Bill implements a new safeguards regime for New Zealand.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Safeguards are emergency measures applied at the border, usually in the form of a duty, which may be taken to provide temporary protection to a domestic industry from injury caused by a surge in imported goods resulting from unforeseen developments. Safeguards are provided for under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (<def-term id="DLM1587402">GATT</def-term>) and the World Trade Organisation (<def-term id="DLM1587403">WTO</def-term>) Agreement on Safeguards and are intended to facilitate adjustment by a domestic industry to increased imports.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This Bill repeals the Temporary Safeguard Authorities Act 1987, which embodies New Zealandâ€™s current safeguards regime, and replaces it with a new regime designed to ensure that it is consistent with WTO rules and to promote efficient, transparent, and objective investigative and decision-making processes.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill includes matters that must be considered when determining whether the application of a safeguard measure is in the public interest. This inclusion is aimed at promoting certainty and transparency. The Bill provides that safeguard investigations be undertaken by the Ministry of Economic Development rather than by independent Temporary Safeguard Authorities, to allow the expertise of the Ministry to be fully utilised in the undertaking of investigations and align the conduct of safeguard investigations with those for other trade remedy investigations into dumped or subsidised imports.  The Bill extends the time frame for completing such investigations to ensure a WTO-compliant investigation can be undertaken.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Where a safeguard measure is warranted, the Bill provides for the responsible Minister to impose a final and provisional safeguard duty or to recommend that other measures be taken. To comply with WTO rules, the Bill also authorises the Minister of Commerce to extend, liberalise, and terminate a safeguard duty following a review.</text>

          <text>The Temporary Safeguard Authorities Act 1987 (<def-term id="DLM1587408">TSA Act</def-term>) provides for the investigation required under WTO rules to be carried out by independent Temporary Safeguard Authorities into whether a safeguard measure should be applied. A review of the TSA Act was prompted by decisions of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (the <def-term id="DLM1587409">DSB</def-term>) relating to safeguards. This jurisprudence indicates that it is likely to be very difficult to complete a WTO compliant investigation within the current 30-working-day time frame.</text>

        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The TSA Act currently provides for independent Temporary Safeguard Authorities to undertake investigations despite the expertise for undertaking investigations of this type and the knowledge of WTO safeguard jurisprudence being held within the Ministry. The necessity to extend the investigation time frame is also likely to reduce the availability of suitably qualified persons to act as temporary safeguard authorities, making recruitment more difficult. The TSA Act also lacks a mechanism for applying a safeguard measure. In order to apply a measure, recourse to other legislative instruments is necessary. Safeguard measures in the form of duties or quantitative restrictions must be implemented under other instruments by Order in Council, a potentially lengthy process which can reduce the potential effectiveness of the measure.</text>

        <para>
          <text>While only 4 investigations have been carried out under the TSA Act since 1987, with 1 resulting in a safeguard being applied, the ongoing potential for volatility in international markets and New Zealand's current tariff liberalisation agenda heighten the likelihood of a New Zealand industry seeking a safeguard investigation. This potentially exposes New Zealand to greater risk of WTO dispute settlement, highlighting the need to improve the efficiency and clarity of safeguards legislation.</text>

        <para>
          <text>The key benefit of the preferred option to Government is a significant reduction in the risk of a successful WTO dispute settlement or judicial review, should an investigation be concluded and a safeguard measure applied.  Like judicial review, a WTO dispute is a costly and resource intensive process, requiring consultation between disputing parties and providing for a complainant to request establishment of a panel to adjudicate on the matter where no agreement is reached. Requiring the Ministry of Economic Development to undertake investigations rather than independent Temporary Safeguard Authorities will also reduce costs, with most investigation costs being met out of existing Ministry budgets and resources.</text>

        <para>
          <text>There are not expected to be any significant additional costs to business (principally domestic industry, competing importers, and their respective customers) arising out of the proposals made here. Costs to business largely involve preparing for, and participating in, a safeguard investigation. Although an extension is proposed to the investigation time frame, because the key evidentiary components of the investigation remain essentially unchanged, no significant increase in the cost to participate is expected.</text>
        </para>

          <text>Business will benefit from improved clarity in legislation, transparency of process, and the creation of a single government point of contact for all trade remedy inquiries.</text>

          <text>New Zealand as a whole benefits significantly from the reduction of trade barriers. As a limited exception to freer trade, an effective safeguard regime has the potential to promote support for future trade liberalisation among import-competing domestic manufacturers.  </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>An effective safeguard regime, as part of a coherent trade remedies regime, could also have positive effects on investment by providing a means to protect domestic industry from international supply shocks. The temporary, targeted, and adjustment orientation of safeguards means they are not contrary, but complementary, to trade policies such as tariff reduction.</text>

          <text>Consultation was undertaken, through the release of a discussion paper, with a range of New Zealand business groups and firms.

        <para>
          <text>The proposed guidelines for considering whether a safeguard measure is in the public interest were not canvassed in the discussion paper.  Although this proposal was not canvassed, guidelines are favoured because they promote certainty and transparency of process without altering the status quo in terms of core considerations of the decision-maker and investigating body.  Stakeholders will also have the opportunity to make submissions on appropriate guidelines during the select committee stage.</text>

        <para>
          <text>Some submitters supported an amended investigation time frame shorter than that proposed.  Officials consider that the proposed time frames are the minimum times required to complete a WTO compliant investigation, one of the central policy objectives of the review.</text>
