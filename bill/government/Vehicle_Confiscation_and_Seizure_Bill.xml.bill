The existing section permits the Registrar to arrange for the sale of the motor vehicle by public auction or in any other manner that the court may direct. The amendment enables sales in any manner the Registrar thinks fit, subject to any direction by the court. The amendment also re-enacts the provision that sets out priorities for applying the proceeds of a motor vehicle sold by the court. The substantive change made by the amendment is to give the towing and storage costs incurred in impounding a motor vehicle under the Land Transport Act 1998 priority over all other payments. A new provision is added concerning the proceeds from the sale of a motor vehicle owned by a substitute for the offender. Those proceeds may be applied in payment of only those fines and reparation imposed for offences committed by the offender in a vehicle that, at the material time, was owned by the substitute. They may thus not be applied to pay for fines or reparation imposed for offences committed in other circumstances, for example for offences the offender committed while using the offender's own vehicle.</text>

        <explnote.ird-crosshead>Status quo and problem</explnote.ird-crosshead>
        <para>
          <text>Illegal street racing has been an issue around the country for many years. The harm from illegal street racing can be broken down into three categories: road safety, noise, and public nuisance/disorder.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Between 2003–2007 there were on average 101 crashes a year from wider street racing activity. These crashes resulted in (on average) 10 deaths, 46 serious injuries, and 125 minor injuries a year.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Apprehending a driver or drivers in the act of an illegal street racing activity occurs infrequently and randomly. In the 2003–2007 period, there were on average 1 659 convictions for illegal street racing activity a year. It is hard to know the true extent of illegal street racing as the participants are transitory and highly organised.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>Current penalties for illegal street racing are disqualification and a fine or jail. If a person is convicted twice in 4 years for an illegal street racing offence, the court must order that their vehicle be confiscated unless it will result in extreme hardship to the offender or undue hardship to any other person. Despite confiscation being a discretionary penalty after conviction for 1 qualifying offence and a mandatory penalty after 2 convictions, the actual rate of confiscations is very low. In 2006, there were 9 600 offences in which mandatory confiscation applied, and over 50 000 in which discretionary confiscation applied. There were only 1 062 confiscation orders granted. This puts the current rate of confiscation at less than 2% (or 1 in 10 for mandatory confiscations). </text>

          <text>The cost to Vote Courts of an increase in the number of confiscations by 3 000 per year is estimated to be $0.473 million (operating expenditure only) in year 1 and $1.478 million (operating expenditure only) in year 2 and outyears. There will also be some establishment costs in 2009/10 ($0.612 million capital expenditure).</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Confiscations—Net Crown revenue</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The operational change being made to the confiscations regime will enable any unmet confiscation costs to be collected by the Court as a fine. Based on an additional 3 000 confiscations each year, Crown revenue of approximately $1.2 million is expected. The Ministry of Justice estimates that 80% of this amount will be collected over a 10-year period as Crown revenue.</text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Seizures—Vote Courts</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>Currently, the Ministry of Justice seizes approximately 2 500 vehicles per year to ensure the payment of unpaid fines. The cost to Vote Courts of an additional 500 vehicle seizures per year is estimated to be $0.541 million (operating expenditure only) in year 1, increasing to $0.728 million (operating expenditure only) in outyears. There will also be some establishment costs in 2009/10 (capital expenditure). </text>

        <explnote.subhead2>Confiscation and destruction orders—Vote Courts</explnote.subhead2>
        <para>
          <text>The Ministry of Justice does not expect the new order to be a significant ongoing cost to the Crown. There would be a one-off $80,000 cost to Vote Courts to establish the new orders. This cost is included with the confiscations costs above. Current vehicle confiscation costs average $750 per vehicle. The law provides for these costs to be recovered from the sale of these vehicles (although many vehicles’ values are less than the confiscation costs and these costs must be absorbed by the courts).</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>While less may be recovered from vehicles intended for destruction, the number of orders is likely to be small. In 2007, only 10 offenders were convicted of a third illegal street racing offence within 4 years. </text>
