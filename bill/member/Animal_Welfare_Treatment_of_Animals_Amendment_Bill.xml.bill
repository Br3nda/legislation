        <para>
          <text>There has been considerable disquiet, in recent times, about the Animal Welfare Act 1999 (the <emphasis style="bold">principal Act</emphasis>) allowing practices to continue in New Zealand, even when they breach key sections of the principal Act. </text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>For example, the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (<emphasis style="bold">NAWAC</emphasis>) acknowledges in the Code of Welfare for Pigs (2005), that the use of dry sow stalls for extended periods does not fully meet the obligations of the principal Act. Nevertheless, NAWAC has allowed this practice to continue by using the <quote.in quote="1">exceptional circumstances</quote.in> exception in section 73 of the principal Act.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This contradiction undermines confidence in the principal Act, and in its ability to protect the welfare of animals.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>This Bill clarifies that practices that breach key sections of the principal Act, but which are still permitted in a code of animal welfare under the <quote.in quote="1">exceptional circumstances</quote.in> exception, must be phased out within 5 years.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>In line with international practice, the Bill also clarifies that the definition of <emphasis style="bold">physical, health, and behavioural needs</emphasis> includes animals having freedom of movement, that is not restricted in such a way as to cause them suffering or injury, and sufficient space to express normal patterns of behaviour such as being able to turn around easily and walk about.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <text>The Bill also provides the Minister responsible for the administration of the principal Act with the power to amend or revoke an animal code of welfare, or any minimum standard contained in such a code of welfare, where the Minster considers this is necessary to prevent suffering or injury to any animal.</text>
