      <para>
        <text>This bill amends the Marine Reserves Act 1971 (<amend.in quote="1">the principal Act</amend.in>). Section 5 of the Act sets out a procedure for certain bodies to apply for a marine reserve to be declared by Order in Council. However, some applications have foundered because community groups have not been involved from the outset in developing reserve proposals. This has meant that applications have met with opposition by community groups, particularly out of concern that existing uses of marine areas may be curtailed.</text>

        <text>The Marine Reserves Bill currently before the House also contains a provision requiring consultation during the preparation of a proposal. However, that bill was referred to a select committee 15 October 2002 and has not been reported back. This bill amends the 1971 Act in lieu of the new principal Act passing into law. The Marine Reserves Bill as introduced does not specifically require early consultation with groups that represent existing users of the area proposed for a marine reserve.</text>
