          <text>The principal Act, among other things, constitutes and incorporates the Eden Park Trust Board (the <def-term id="DLM1919703">Trust Board</def-term>), declares the trusts upon which property is held by the Trust Board, and sets out the legal framework for the powers, duties, and functions of the Trust Board.</text>
