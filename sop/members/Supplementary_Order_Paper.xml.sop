    <heading>Explanatory note</heading>
    <para>
      <text>These amendments reinstate the original intention of the Land Transport (Unauthorised Street and Drag Racing) Amendment Act 2003, which was that after two street racing offences within four years, an offenderâ€™s vehicle must be permanently confiscated.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <text>The Vehicle Confiscation and Seizure Bill closes a loophole in that Act, by allowing vehicles owned by a third party, or <quote.in quote="1">substitute for the offender</quote.in>, to also be confiscated. However, the Bill says that confiscation of a vehicle owned by a substitute for the offender is at the discretion of the Court. The amendment to subsection 129(3) of the Sentencing Act 2002 makes it mandatory for the Court to confiscate a vehicle on a second offence within four years, even if it is owned by a substitute for the offender.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <text>The safeguards and appeal rights against seizure and confiscation for a substitute for the offender that are created by this bill remain.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <text>Clauses 8, 14, 16, and 19 are amended or omitted as a result of the amendment to subsection 129(3) of the Sentencing Act 2002 because they relate to the new confiscation and destruction order on a third offence within four years. By amending this bill so that confiscation is mandatory on a second offence within four years, these third offence provisions will not be needed.</text>
