    <heading>Explanatory note</heading>
    <para>
      <text> The purpose of this Supplementary Order Paper is to amend the Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Bill as reported by the Finance and Expenditure Committee to improve transparency. It inserts a new paragraph that requires information about free allocations to be searchable in an aggregated form for each eligible activity, industry or sector.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <text>While some industries have so few competitors that such aggregated information may reveal commercial information, this limited risk is outweighed by the publicâ€™s right to know how much public subsidies are supporting emitters in each subsector of the economy.</text>
